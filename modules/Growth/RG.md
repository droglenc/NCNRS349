1. Read [these notes](BKG.html) and Sections 12.1-12.3 in *Introductory Fisheries Analyses with R* and consider the items below.
    * Define L<sub>&#8734;</sub>, K, t<sub>0</sub>, L<sub>0</sub>, &omega;, L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>, and L<sub>3</sub> (**be very specific with these definitions, possibly including what these items are NOT**.)
    * What data is required to fit a VBGF?
    * Write the equations for the typical, original, Schnute, Gallucci and Quinn, and Francis parametrizations of the von Bertlanffy Growth Function (VBGF).
    * How do the fits of the various VBGF paramegerizatons differ?
    * What are the assumptions required to fit a VBGF with nonlinear regression?
    * What R function is used to find starting values for fitting a VBGF? What arguments does it need?
    * What R function is used for fitting a nonlinear regression? What arguments does it need for fitting a growth model?
    * What function extracts the parameters estimates from the results above?
    * What function extracts confidence intervals for the parameters from the results above?
