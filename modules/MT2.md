The following are possible questions for the final exam.

1. Define all symbols including Rp, Sp, a, b, L<sub>&infin;</sub>, K, t<sub>0</sub>, L<sub>0</sub>, &omega; PSD, PSD-X, PSD-X-Y
1. Be able to quickly describe what each major analytical topic discussed in class is used for (e.g., von Bertalanffy model is used to model growth, catch curve is used to assess mortality).
1. What is recruitment? How is it defined? What are some examples?
1. Define density-independence and density-dependence as it relates to stock-recruit relationships. Draw the relationship of S/R vs S and R vs S.
1. Completely compare and contrast the Beverton-Holt and Ricker stock-recruit models. Define their parameters, identify their shapes, recognize parameters in the equations, identify effects of reduced number of stock on number of recruits.
1. Compute Rp and Sp (if appropriate) from estimates of a and b, identify the effect of increased/decreased a, b values on Rp and Sp.
1. Identify the shape of a von Bertalanffy growth model, recognize parameters in their equations, understand what model parameters represent.
1. Explain common misinterpretations of L<sub>&infin;</sub> and K?
1. What does a larger/smaller K mean in a von Bertalanffy model? Larger/smaller L<sub>&infin;</sub>?
1. Calculate and explain what &omega; is in the Gallucci and Quinn version of the von B.
1. Explain what forces serve to shape a length frequency.
1. Discuss how you would statistically test if two length frequency distributions are similar or not.
1. Construct (roughly) a cumulative frequency distribution from a length frequency distribution.
1. Define stock and quality lengths.
1. Define PSD and PSD-X and compute from a length frequency or reverse cumulative length frequency table.
1. Draw rough length frequency histogram from a given PSD, PSD-X value. Describe what a population looks like based on the PSD, PSD-X values.
1. Provide possible interpretations from a Tic-Tac-Toe graph that uses PSD values.
1. Hypothesize about the structure of a fish community and what forces are important in shaping that community from a length frequency histogram.
1. Mathematically show how to linearize the length-weight power function relationship.
1. Compute/find a and b (on the original scale) from the log(L)-log(W) regression results.
1. Explain what allometric and isometric “growth” is and how one identifies each from a length-weight regression.
1. Define Ws and Wr. From what is Ws derived?
1. Compute Wr given a Ws equation and the length and weight of a fish.
1. Be able to explain and interpret Wr. Describe ecological or physiological characteristics of the population based on Wr values.
1. Describe what the populations of Bluegill, Yellow Perch, and Largemouth Bass are likely to “look like” (in terms of size, condition, abundance, and mortality) in a lake that has been closed to angling and that same lake within one year after having been opened up to angling.
1. Compute, from a table harvest bags, how many anglers are affected and how many fish are not harvested if a bag limit is reduced.
1. Describe typical management objectives for bag limits and minimum, harvest slot, and protected slot length limits.
1. Describe the conditions of a fish population and its associated fishery that most commonly lead to the management objectives for bag limits and minimum, harvest slot, and protected slot length limits being met.
1. Describe what the primary benefits of individual quotas are.
1. Describe what the primary benefits of coarse woody habitat are.
