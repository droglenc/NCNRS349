## Description

A study of exploited populations of fish and other aquatic organisms.  Theory and methods of defining fish growth, survival, mortality, abundance, and community interactions will be emphasized.  Wisconsin, Great Lakes, and marine fisheries will be addressed.  Pre-requisite BIO234, BIO242, [MTH107](http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/).  4 Credits.


## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this class you will be able to ...

1. Explain a conceptual model for the population dynamics of a stock.
1. Estimate abundance from mark-recapture and depletion data.
1. Implement an age-length key.
1. Estimate mortality from catch-at-age data.
1. Estimate growth from length-at-age data.
1. Fit and interpret stock-recruitment curves.
1. Compute and interpret length frequency summaries and size structure indices.
1. Compute and interpret condition indices.
1. Describe the components of the fisheries management environment and the relationships between those components.
1. Describe the steps in and components of the fisheries management process.
1. Describe how the concept of common property influences the behavior of fishers.
1. Explain the purposes, strengths and limitations for a variety of management tools (including length limits, bag limits, closed seasons, refuges, stocking, ITQs, and catch shares).
1. Make management recommendations that are founded on sound ecological reasoning and knowledge of fish biology, fisheries science, and adaptive management results.

## Grading

An overall percentage score will be computed from the items and associated weights listed in the table below.  A specific description for each item is given further below.  You can also use this table to compute your current or projected future grade.  To compute your current grade, enter your percentage scores in the boxes for assessments that have been completed.  To project your future grade, also include percentages for future assessements.  [*It is your responsibility to track your scores on the individual assessments.*]

<!-- if the assessment weights change then you must change the values in get_wghts() in the grader.js file -->

<form name="GRADECALC">
<table class="grader">

Lowest possible final letter grades will be assigned by comparing your overall percentage score (rounded to a whole number) to the values shown below:

<table class="tg">
  <tr><td></td><td>A 92-100</td><td>A- 90-91</td></tr>
  <tr><td>B+ 87-89</td><td>B  82-86</td><td>B- 80-81</td></tr>

### Homework

Several homework assignments will be assigned per major course topic.  Grading of each assignment will be described on the assignment sheet.  Completed homework assignments will be due at the beginning of the class period on dates announced when the homework was assigned.  Assignments will be accepted up to one day late but will be reduced by 50% of the worth of the assignment.  Assignments not handed in at the beginning of the class period will be considered one day late.  **If there is any indication, whether I can confirm it or not, that you have not worked alone on your homework, then you will receive a 0 for that homework and will be warned of further penalties for subsequent offenses.**

### Exams

Exams dates are shown on the [Dates page](calendar.html){:target="_blank"}.  Make-up exams will be provided only if you have a fixed commitment of sufficient importance that was set before the beginning of the semester or a verifiable medical condition.  You will not be allowed to make up an exam missed without my prior approval.  The final exam will not be given early.

### Reflections - CFOOD Myths



### Reflections - Speakers

Several guest speakers will visit our class during the semester.  I expect that you will be attentive to each of these speakers, including asking relevant questions.  At the beginning of the first class period following each speaker, you will hand in a completed "reflection" regarding the guest speakers visit.  That reflections should contain *at least* the following information.

1. What was the speaker's name, title, and affiliation (i.e., where they work)?
1. What was the title of the speaker's presentation?
1. What is your summary of the speaker's presentation, including your list of the speaker's three main points?
1. How did the speaker's presentation pertain to our class?  [*Be specific*]
1. What questions did you ask the speaker and what were his/her answers?  [*Required*]
1. What questions do you wish you would have asaked the speaker?
1. What other thoughts do you have?

### Extra Credit

I will offer some opportunities for extra credit throughout the semester.  Generally these opportunities will be related to your reflections from attending presentations, meetings, etc. related to fisheries science and management that are outside of the class.  Examples would be attending the AFS Conference in late Feb and attending the Conservation Congress hearings in early April.

### Incomplete Grades

Under Northland College policy, an incomplete grade will be given ONLY under extreme circumstances beyond your control, such as a major illness.  An incomplete grade will be given ONLY if you have successfully completed the entire course except for the final exam.

## Professionalism

### Attendance
For most students, achievement is strongly positively related to attendance.  I will take attendance each day but attendance will not factor into your final grade with the following exception.  At the end of the semester I may, at my discretion, decide to eliminate one or more of your homework or exam grades.  Your attendance record will be one item considered when I make this decision.

### Participation
As a general rule-of-thumb ([here](http://www.collegeparents.org/members/resources/articles/your-college-student-investing-enough-time-studying){:target="_blank"}, [here](http://classroom.synonym.com/ratio-studying-class-time-college-1075.html){:target="_blank"}, [here](https://www.usu.edu/asc/idea_sheets/pdf/estimate_study_hours.pdf){:target="_blank"}, and [here](http://collegelife.about.com/od/academiclife/f/How-Much-Time-Should-I-Spend-Studying-In-College.htm){:target="_blank"}, among many), students are expected to spend between 2-3 hours of time outside of class for each hour in class.  This course meets for 5 hours per week and, thus, I expect between 10 and 15 hours of time outside of class will be dedicated to preparing for class, completing homework and other assessments, and studying for exams.  I fully believe that the work required for this course can be completed within this expected amount of time, **if that time is quality-time** (i.e., without distraction).

If you feel that you are spending an inordinate amount of time on some assignments because you are "stuck," then start your assignments early so that you can stop (and do other things) and make plans to see [me](#instructor) for help.

### Expectations
This is a 300-level science course that is required in only one major; thus, you either selected that major or this course and I assume then that this subject is of great interest to you.  This course is intense (both in quantity and quality of work) and I expect that you will appreciate that and honor that with considerable effort.  I expect that you are conversant with topics from the three pre-requisite courses (Ecology, Ichthyology, and Introductory Statistics).  Additionally, I expect that you have reached a high-level of intellectual maturity by this stage of your academic career and, thus, will act professionally at all times, ask good and synthesizing questions, and communicate effectively, both orally and [in writing](writing-tips.html).  Finally, I expect you to work hard, but have fun doing that work.

### Conduct
Your conduct in class should revolve around the idea of being respectful of all others in the class.  Adhering to the following policies should be considered the minimum requirements to being respectful of others:

* Arrive to class on time.  If you arrive late, then take the first available seat as quietly as possible.
* Do not bring friends, children, pets, meals, or anything else to class that should not be there.
* Turn off and store out-of-sight cell phones and other electronic devices (use of a personal laptop for work related to class is permitted).
* Do not use the college or personal computers for other than assigned tasks.
* Do not engage in side discussions while I or others are speaking to the entire class.
* Do not use disrespectful language when addressing others.

You will be asked to leave class if your behavior is disrespectful of others.
