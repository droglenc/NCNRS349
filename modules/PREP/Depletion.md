Read [Rosenberger's Box 11.1](RESOURCES/Popeetal-2010-Box11-1.pdf) in Pope *et al.* (2010) (the complete chapter [is here](http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2010_pope_k001.pdf)) and answer the following questions.

{:start="19"}
1. What is a primary assumption of the removal method?
1. Describe a common behavior of fish that leads to a violation of this assumption?
1. What does this particular assumption violation mean for the estimates of abundance and catchability from the removal method?
1. What is the author's argument for how biased results from the removal method could still be useful?
1. However, how does the stated findings from the Rosenberger and Dunham (2005) study go against the previous argument?
