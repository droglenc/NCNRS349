<li><b>Citation:</b> Ogle, D.H. and K.F. Schanning.  2012.  Usage of "Sex" and "Gender".  Fisheries.  37:271-272.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Objectives:</b> The objectives of Ogle and Schanning (2012) was to describe that "gender" is misused for "sex" in fisheries articles and show that this mistake is prevalent.</li>
<li><b>Background:</b> Ogle and Schanning describe how "gender" and "sex" were once synonyms but that "sex" now has a strict biological meaning (based on reproductive organs) and "gender" is constructed by a society.  Thus, "gender" and "sex" are not synonyms and should <b>not</b> be used interchangeably.</li>
<li><b>Findings:</b> Nearly all uses of "gender" in the sample of fisheries articles was classified as a misues.  The prevalence of "gender" has increased in three of the four fisheries journal sampled.  Misuses also occurred in fisheries textbooks.</li>
<li><b>Summary:</b> This research shows that "gender" is commonly misused in the fisheries literature.  The authors argue that these misuses stem from authors and editors attempting to be politically correct or to provide variety in their prose.  The authors argue, though, that the continued misuse of "gender" runs the risk of eroding respest for the science.</li>
<li><b>Comments:</b> I found the author's arguments and findings compelling.  There is simply no reason for a fisheries scientist to use "gender" in place of "sex" when referring to the biology of fishes.  I will actively avoid making this mistake in my writing and speaking.</li>
