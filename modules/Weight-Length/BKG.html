<h1>Weight-Length Relationships</h1>
<p>Modeling the relationship between length and weight of a species of fish has been considered a routine analysis for which the results do not warrant publication <span class="citation">(Froese 2006)</span> or has been scorned as being of little value <span class="citation">(Hilborn and Walters 2001)</span>. However, the recent review of methods and the meta-analysis of a large number of length-weight relationships by <span class="citation">Froese (2006)</span> demonstrated that a synthetic analysis of length-weight relationships for a species can provide important insights into the ecology of that species.</p>
<p>The relationship between the length and weight of a fish is used by fisheries researchers and managers for two main purposes <span class="citation">(Le Cren 1951)</span>. First, the relationship is used to predict the weight from the length of a fish. This is particularly useful for computing the biomass of a sample of fish from the length-frequency of that sample. Second, the parameter estimates of the relationship for a population of fish can be compared to average parameters for the region, parameter estimates from previous years, or parameter estimates among groups of fish to identify the relative condition or robustness of the population. By convention, this second purpose is usually generically referred to as describing the <em>condition</em> of the species.</p>
<div id="weight-length-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Weight-Length Data</h3>
<p>The required data for examining the length-weight relationship for a sample of fish is measurements of the length (<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>) and weight (<span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>) of individual fish at the time of capture (e.g., Table 1). Any other data about individual fish, such as month or year of capture, are of capture, etc. can also be recorded.</p>

<p>Three types of length measurements are common in the fisheries literature Figure 1. <em>Total length</em> (TL) is the length from the most anterior to the most posterior point with the tail of the fish compressed to exhibit the longest possible length. <em>Fork length</em> (FL) is the length from the most anterior point to the anterior notch in the fork of the tail. For fish without a forked tail, the fork and total lengths are the same. The <em>standard length</em> (SL) is the length from the most anterior point to the posterior end of the caudal peduncle. Total length is the most common measurement in fisheries studies, as this is the measurement used in management decisions such as setting minimum lengths.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Figure 1: Demonstration of total, fork, and standard length measurements on a Bluegill.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Length measurements are often taken with the aid of a measuring board where the measuring “stick” is embedded into the bottom board and one end of this board is fit with a vertical end piece. The fish to be measured is placed on the bottom board such that the anterior point of the fish is against the vertical end piece and the measurement can be read directly from the embedded measuring stick (Figure 2). Length measurements are subject to very little measurement error <span class="citation">(Gutreuter and Krzoska 1994)</span>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="LengthWeightMeasure.png" />

</div>
<p>Figure 2: Field measurements of length (left) and weight with a spring scale (right).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Two common weight measurements are used. The usual body weight is the weight of the fish as it was captured, whereas the dressed weight is the weight of the fish with the gills and entrails removed. Dressed weight is usually only used when measurements are reported from a commercial fishery.</p>
<p>Weight measurements can be made in the field on fresh specimens or in the lab on fresh-frozen specimens. Weight measurements in the field can be taken with tared spring or electronic balances (Figure 2). However, field measurements can be extremely variable due to differences in fish surface wetness, boat movements, wind, and other adverse environmental conditions <span class="citation">(Gutreuter and Krzoska 1994)</span>. Substantial variability in weight measurements can occur when fish weigh less than 10% of a scale’s capacity <span class="citation">(Gutreuter and Krzoska 1994)</span>. Thus, multiple sizes of scales should be taken into the field <span class="citation">(Blackwell et al. 2000)</span>. <span class="citation">Wege and Anderson (1978)</span>} suggest that the accuracy of the scale should be $$1% of a fish’s body weight for use in relative weight calculations. Weight measurements on frozen fish were roughly 1-9% lighter than the measurements on the same fish when fresh, whereas length measurements were roughly 1-4% shorter on frozen then fresh fish for a variety of species (reviewed in <span class="citation">Ogle (2009)</span>).</p>
</div>
<div id="weight-length-model" class="section level3">
<h3>Weight-Length Model</h3>
<p>The relationship between the length and weight of a sample of fish tends to have two important characteristics. First, the relationship is not linear . This can be explained intuitively by thinking of length as a linear measure and weight as being related to volume. Thus, as the organism adds a linear amount of length, it is adding a disk of volume with a commensurate weight. Second, the variability in weight increases as the length of the fish increases (i.e., the scatter of the points increases from left-to-right in Figure 3. Thus, variability in weight among shorter fish is less then variability in weight among longer fish. Unfortunately, because of these two characteristics, length-weight data tends to violate the linearity and homoscedasticity (i.e., “constant variance”) assumptions of simple linear regression.</p>
<p><img src="BKG_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="336" /></p>
<p>Figure 3: Length and weight of Ruffe from the St. Louis River Harbor, 1992.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These characteristics of length-weight data suggest that a two-parameter power function with a multiplicative error term should be used to model the length-weight relationship. Specifically, the model typically used is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ W_{i} = aL_{i}^{b}e^{\epsilon_{i}} \quad \quad \text{(1)} \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are constants and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{i}\)</span> is the multiplicative error term for the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th fish. The length-weight model Equation 1 can be <em>transformed</em> to a linear model by taking the natural logarithms<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> of both sides and simplifying,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ log(W_{i}) = log(a) + blog(L_{i}) + \epsilon_{i} \quad \quad \text{(1)} \]</span></p>
<p>Thus, with <span class="math inline">\(y=log(W)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x=log(L)\)</span>, slope=<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and intercept=<span class="math inline">\(log(a)\)</span>, Equation 2 is in the form of a linear model. In addition to linearizing the model, this transformation has the added benefit of making the errors additive and stabilizing the variances about the model (i.e., making the scatter around the line nearly constant for all length measurements; Figure 4). With this linearization and stabilization, the usual linear regression methods can be used to fit the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(log(W)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(log(L)\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="BKG_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="336" /></p>
<p>Figure 4: Natural log transformed total length and weight of Ruffe from the St. Louis River Harbor, 1992. Note that the “flaring” of the values in the lower-left corner of the plot is due to minimum weight limitations of the measuring scale.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It should be noted that, with the example in Figure 4, the variability on the log scale appears greater for ``small’’ fish. This is because the scale used to measure these fish lacked the required precision to distinguish weights of small fish over a wide length range. It is apparent that fish with a log weight of less than -0.5 should be eliminated from this analysis because of scale imprecision for these fish.</p>
</div>
<div id="special-inferences-about-slope" class="section level3">
<h3>Special Inferences about Slope</h3>
<p>If a fish grows without changing its shape or its density then the fish is said to exhibit <em>isometric</em> growth. In this case, the volume of the fish is proportional to any linear measure of its size. If weight is taken as a surrogate of volume (which requires assuming a constant density) and length as the linear measure, then the modeled relationship between length and weight, Equation 1, will have <span class="math inline">\(b=3\)</span> under isometric growth. Isometric growth in fish is rare <span class="citation">(Bolger and Connolly 1989, <span class="citation">McGurk (1985)</span>)</span>. If a fish changes shape or density as it grows, then <span class="math inline">\(b\neq3\)</span> in Equation 1, and the fish is said to exhibit <em>allometric</em> growth. If <span class="math inline">\(b&gt;3\)</span> then the fish tends to become more “plumper” as the fish increases in length <span class="citation">(Blackwell et al. 2000)</span>.</p>
<p>A test of whether the fish in a population exhibit isometric growth or not can be obtained by noting that <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the estimated slope from fitting the transformed length-weight model. The slope is generically labeled with <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> such that the test for allometry can be translated into the following statistical hypotheses:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(H_{0}:\beta=3 \quad \Rightarrow H_{0}:\)</span> “Isometric growth”</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(H_{A}:\beta\neq3 \quad \Rightarrow H_{A}:\)</span> “Allometric growth”’</li>
</ul>
<p>Hypothesis tests regarding model parameters can be obtained with a t-test using</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ t = \frac{\hat{\beta}-\beta_{0}}{SE_{\hat{\beta}}} \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(SE_{\hat{\beta}}\)</span> and the df are from the linear regression results and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{0}\)</span> is the specified value in the <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}\)</span>. Nearly all statistical packages, R included, print the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and corresponding <span class="math inline">\(p-value\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}:\beta=0\)</span> by default, but not for any hypothesized value other than zero. Thus, the test statistic and p-value for the test of isometry must often be calculated “by hand.”</p>
