The following are possible questions for the midterm exam.

- Scientific names of Walleye, Lake Trout, Brook Trout, Coho Salmon, Sockeye Salmon, Brown Trout, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Arctic Charr, Black Crappie, Sea Lamprey
- Define all symbols including:
    - N<sub>0</sub>, q, Z, F, M, A, S, u, v, m, n, C<sub>t</sub>, f<sub>t</sub>, N<sub>t</sub>, r
    - M,n,m from mark-recapture

- Identify different types of fishing regulations (e.g., minimum size, hartvest slot, bag limit, gear restrictions, etc.)

- Describe a conceptual model of a stock (i.e., what things effect stock abundance and biomass)
- Write discrete and continuous population growth models and define terms.
-	Density-dependence – define, example graphs, example explanations (e.g., depletion of resources lead to increase mortality, decrease in fecundity, etc.)
-	Types of dynamics with different values of r in a discrete popn growth model.

-	What is the catch equation, define all aspects
-	Define q, q&times;f<sub>t</sub>, q&times;N<sub>t</sub>, q&times;f<sub>t</sub>&times;N<sub>t</sub>
-	Define CPE, why would we use it
-	Thoroughly discuss hyperstability and hyperdepletion?
-	What does Maunder argue are flaws with CPUE data.  Provide specific examples.

-	Describe how the Leslie methods can be used to estimate population sizes.
- Calculate q and N<sub>0</sub> from Leslie model regression results.
- Understand the geometrical representation of N<sub>0</sub> on a Leslie model plot.
-	What happens to q or N<sub>0</sub> estimates if mortality/recruitment exist.
-	What happens to Leslie model shape if catchability increases/decreases?
-	Four main assumptions of Leslie model and how do we try to make sure they are met.
-	Explain which assumption of depletion/removal methods is most commonly violated.  Why?
-	Summarize Rosenberger’s (2010) argument.

-	Why use Chapman vs. Petersen?
-	Understand capture histories; derive M, m, and n from capture history summaries.
-	Perform a Chapman M/R calculation from raw values.
-	Assumptions, and what violations do to population estimates.

- Identify types and key features of scales and otoliths.
- Explain the advantages and disadvantages of the various structures used to assign age to fish.
- Back-calculate previous length from measurements on a scale/otolith and the fish's length at capture.

-	Compute an age-length key from a two-way table.
-	Identify proportions and number of fish that will be assigned a certain age from an age-length key according to the Isermann-Knight method.
-	Describe how an age-length-key is used in the Isermann-Knight method.
-	Describe why age-length-keys are used.

-	Describe difference between cross-sectional and longitudinal catch curves
-	Identify vectors of catch and ages from a matrix of catches-at-age for cross-sectional and longitudinal catch curves.
-	Interpret Z and A
-	Compute A from Z, Z from A
-	Look at two plots and identify the one with the higher mortality rate

-	Assumptions? How does shape of catch-curve change if assumptions are violated?
-	Describe the “limbs” of a catch curve and explain why they appear the way they do.
-	Describe ways in which F and M can be estimated.
-	Compute the exploitation rate from mark-recapture results
- Compute A from estimates of F and M.
