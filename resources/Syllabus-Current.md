## Grading
An overall percentage score will be computed from the items and associated weights listed in the table below. To compute your current grade, enter your percentage scores in the boxes for assessments that have been completed. To project your future grade, also include percentages for future assessments. Put your highest midterm grade in MT1. [*It is your responsibility to track your scores on the individual assessments.*]

<!-- if the assessment weights change then you must change the values in get_wghts() in the grader.js file -->

<form name="GRADECALC">
<table class="grader">
<tr><th></th>
<th><a href="#homework">HW</a></th>
<th><a href="#exams">MT1</a></th>
<th><a href="#exams">MT2</a></th>
<th><a href="#exams">Final</a></th>

Lowest possible final letter grades will be assigned by comparing your overall percentage score (rounded to a whole number) to the values shown below:

<table class="tg">
  <tr><td></td><td>A 92-100</td><td>A- 90-91</td></tr>
  <tr><td>B+ 87-89</td><td>B  82-86</td><td>B- 80-81</td></tr>
  <tr><td>C+ 77-79</td><td>C  70-76</td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>D+ 67-69</td><td>D  60-66</td><td>F   0-59</td></tr>
</table>

#### Homework
Several homework assignments will be assigned per major course topic. **PRINTED** assignments are **due at the beginning of the class period on the assigned due date** (announced in class and on the [Dates page](Dates-Current)). Assignments not handed in at the beginning of the class period will be considered late. Late assignments will not be accepted. The lowest approximately 20% of homework grades will be excluded when computing your overall grade.

Each homework assigment is worth 10 points and will be graded in two parts.  The first part is an assessment of completeness and formatting (each assignment should follow [the expectations outlined here](hwformat)) according to the following rubric.

<div class="container-fluid">
  <table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr class="info"><th>0-1 points</th><th>2-4 points</th><th>5 points</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Very few questions answered completely.</td><td>Most questions answered completely. <a href="hwformat.html" target="_blank">Format for homework</a> may not have been followed.</td><td>All questions answered completely. <a href="hwformat.html" target="_blank">Format for homework</a> followed exactly.</td></tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

The second part, also worth 5 points, is an assessment of the quality of the work.  In this part, only some (approximately half) of the questions will be assessed.  Answer keys will be [posted online](homework-keys) so that you may check your work.

**If there is any indication, whether I can confirm it or not, that you have not worked alone on your homework, then you will receive a 0 for that homework and will be warned of further penalties for subsequent offenses.**

#### Exams
Exams dates are shown on the [Dates page](Dates-Current.html).  Make-up exams will be provided only if you have a fixed commitment of sufficient importance that was set before the beginning of the semester or a verifiable medical condition.  You will not be allowed to make up an exam missed without my prior approval.  The final exam will not be given early.

#### Reflections - News Item
In fisheries, as in other scientific disciplines, it is important to keep up with current news in the field. To promote this, you will provide a written reflection of your reading of a current (*within the last six months*) news item. Your reflection should contain *at least* the following information.

1. A viable link or printed copy of the news item.
1. A thorough one-paragraph summary (*in your own words*) of the article.
1. A thoughtful one-paragraph reaction or reflection to the article. [*Do you agree or disagree with the main premise of the article? How do you feel about the event or issue in the article? How does the event or issue in the article affect you?*]
1. A thoughtful one-paragraph description of how the topic of the article relates to class? [*What course topics does the article relate to? How did the article inform your understanding of a class topic? What questions about a class topic did this article raise for you?*]

Your reflection should be 1-2 pages long (12 pt Times New Roman font, single-spaced, 1-in margins, <3 lines of title), typed, and printed to hand in. Reflections are **due at the beginning of the class period on the assigned due date** (on the [Dates page](Dates-Current)). Reflections not handed in at the beginning of the class period will be considered late. Late reflections will not be accepted.

While it is a bit cheesy, [this resource](http://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Current-Events-Summary){:target="_blank"} provides good general guidelines for preparing your reflection. [Here is an example reflection](ex-reflection-paper).  Also, read [these writing tips](writing-tips).

#### Extra Credit
I will offer limited opportunities for extra credit throughout the semester.  Generally these opportunities will be related to your reflections from attending presentations, meetings, etc. related to fisheries science and management that are outside of the class.  Examples would be attending the AFS Conference in late Feb and the Conservation Congress hearings in early April.

### Incomplete Grades
Under [Northland College policy](https://my.northland.edu/student-policies/academic-policies/#grades){:target="_blank"} (scroll down to "Incomplete Grades"), an incomplete grade will be given ONLY under extreme circumstances beyond your control, such as a major illness.  An incomplete grade will be given ONLY if you have successfully completed the entire course except for the final exam.

## Professionalism

#### Attendance
For most students, achievement is strongly positively related to attendance.  I will take attendance each day but attendance will not factor into your final grade with the following exception.  At the end of the semester I may, at my discretion, decide to eliminate one or more of your homework or exam grades.  Your attendance record will be one item considered when I make that decision.

#### Participation
As a general rule-of-thumb ([here](https://www.collegeparentcentral.com/2010/02/is-your-college-student-investing-enough-time-studying/){:target="_blank"}, [here](http://classroom.synonym.com/ratio-studying-class-time-college-1075.html){:target="_blank"}, [here](https://www.usu.edu/asc/studysmart/pdf/estimating_study_hours.pdf){:target="_blank"}, and [here](http://collegelife.about.com/od/academiclife/f/How-Much-Time-Should-I-Spend-Studying-In-College.htm){:target="_blank"}, among many), students are expected to spend between 2-3 hours of time outside of class for each hour in class.  This course meets for 4.5 hours per week and, thus, you should dedicate between 9 and 13.5 hours of time outside of class to preparing for class, completing homework and other assessments, and studying for exams.  The work required for this course can be completed within this expected amount of time, **if that time is quality-time** (i.e., without distraction). If you feel that you are spending an inordinate amount of time on some assignments because you are "stuck," then start your assignments early so that you can stop (and do other things) and make plans to see [me](#instructor) for help.

#### Expectations
This is a 300-level science course that is required in only one major; thus, you either selected that major or this course and I assume then that this subject is of great interest to you.  This course is intense (both in quantity and quality of work) and I expect that you will appreciate that and honor that with considerable effort.  I expect that you are conversant with topics from the three prerequisite courses (Ecology, Ichthyology, and Introductory Statistics).  Additionally, I expect that you have reached a high-level of intellectual maturity by this stage of your academic career and, thus, will act professionally at all times, ask good and synthesizing questions, and communicate effectively, both orally and [in writing](writing-tips.html).  Finally, I expect you to work hard, but have fun doing that work.

## Classroom Conduct and Academic Integrity

Your conduct in class should revolve around the idea of being respectful of all others in the class.  Adhering to the following behaviors should be considered the minimum requirements to being respectful of others:

* Arrive to class on time.  If you arrive late, then take the first available seat as quietly as possible.  If you need to leave early, then please sit near the exit.
* You are expected to attend the entire class period.  Leaving class early defeats the purpose of the class period, does not take advantage of resources (i.e., the professor) that can significantly help your learning, and does not build statistical stamina.
* Turn off and store out-of-sight cell phones and other electronic devices
* Computer use is limited to class work.
* If you choose to use your own computer, then please sit as far forward in class as possible.
* Do not engage in side discussions while I or others are speaking to the entire class.
*	Do not sleep in class -- this behavior is rude and distracting to others (especially the professor).
* Unpack before and pack after class -- opening and closing  backpacks, rustling of papers or jackets is disruptive and disrespectful to others.
* Do not use disrespectful language when addressing others.

Finally, note that the [College's Academic Integrity Statement & Policy](https://my.northland.edu/student-policies/academic-policies/#academic-integrity){:target="_blank"} will be followed in this course.  Please make sure that you are familiar with its content.

## Accommodations
It is the policy and practice of Northland College to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law.  *If you have already established accommodations* with the Office of Accessibility Resources (OAR), please communicate your approved accommodations to me as soon as possible so that we can discuss your needs in this course.  *If you have not yet established services* through OAR, but have a condition that requires accommodations (e.g., attention, learning, vision, hearing, mental, physical, or other health related concern), you should contact OAR (Ponzio 231 or 715-682-1387) or [Donna Jones-Ilsley, Coordinator of Student Accessibility Resources](mailto:djones-ilsley@northland.edu).
