1. Re-read Section 7.3.4 in [Regulating Harvest (Isermann and Paukert, 2010)](IsermannPaukert_2010_HarvestRegulations.pdf) and consider the following items.
    * Differentiate between minimum, maximum, protected slot, and harvest slot length limits.
    * What are typical possible responses of a fishery to the implementation of length limits?
    * Describe population characteristics (density, growth, etc.) for when a protected slot or a harvest slot should be implemented.
1. Read [The Role of Size Limits in Walleye Management (Brousseau and Armstrong (1987)](BrousseauArmstrong_1987_WAELengthLimits.pdf) and consider the following items.
    * What are five potential objectives for implementing size limits on Walleye fisheries?  Which is most common?
    * Describe population characteristics (density, growth, etc.) for when a minimum, protected slot, or maximum length limit should be implemented.
    * Explain why the author suggests that length limits should be applied on a lake-specific rather than state-wide basis.  Why is this seldom followed in practice?
    * List and describe factors that may create obstacles to the success of length limit regulations?
1. Read [Allen's Managing Bass Fisheries with Size Limits](http://www.bassresource.com/fish_biology/selective_harvest.html) and consider the following items.
    * What are the three factors that typically determine the success or failure of a length limit?  Define each.  Explain how each of these items may affect your determination to use one of the length limits or not? [For example, which of these items or combination of these items generally leads to a successful application of a protected slot length limit?]
    * Describe how the author's beliefs have about strict catch-and-release have changed over time.
    * How has the strict catch-and-release ethic of most black bass anglers affected manager's ability to manage fish poplations?
1. Read [Oklahoma Wildlife Department's Bass Length Limits](http://www.wildlifedepartment.com/fishing/fishid/bass_length_limits.pdf) and consider the following items.
    * Compare "selective harvest" to "catch and release."
    * Describe population characteristics (density, growth, etc.) from when a minimum or protected slot should be implemented.
