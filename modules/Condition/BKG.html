<h1>Body Condition</h1>
<p>Condition is a measure of the physical health of a population of fish based on the fish’s relative plumpness or fatness. Most often condition is computed by comparing the actual weight of a fish to some expectation of weight based on the length of the fish. In other words, measuring the condition of a particular fish is an exercise in determining if it weighs more or less than would be expected based on its length. An overall measure of condition for an entire population is obtained by averaging the condition of all fish in a sample.</p>
<p>The utility of measuring fish conditions was summarized by <span class="citation">Blackwell et al. (2000)</span> in the following manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fish condition can be extremely important to fisheries managers. Plump fish may be indicators of favorable environmental conditions (e.g., habitat conditions, ample prey availability), whereas thin fish may indicate less favorable environmental conditions. Thus, being able to monitor fish well-being can be extremely useful for fisheries biologists who must make management recommendations concerning fish populations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are at least eight metrics of condition <span class="citation">(Bolger and Connolly 1989)</span> of which three are commonly used by fisheries managers <span class="citation">(Blackwell et al. 2000)</span>. These three measures are introduced below and discussed within the context of four properties that should be evident in all condition metrics <span class="citation">(Murphy et al. 1990)</span>. Those four properties are (1) consistency – similar statistical properties and meaning regardless of species or length; (2) tractability – analysis by standard statistical methods; (3) efficiency – relative precision from small samples; and (4) robustness – relative insensitivity to variations in the way the data was collected and analyzed.</p>
<div id="fultons-condition-factor" class="section level3">
<h3>Fulton’s Condition Factor</h3>
<p>Fulton’s condition factor is calculated with</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ K = \frac{W}{L^{3}}*constant \]</span></p>
<p>where the constant is simply a scaling factor that is equal to <span class="math inline">\(100000\)</span> if metric units are used (i.e., grams and millimeters) or <span class="math inline">\(10000\)</span> if English units are used (i.e., pounds and inches).{^1] Fulton’s condition factor <em>assumes isometric growth</em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> If a fish stock does not exhibit isometric growth, which is often the case, then <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> tends to differ depending on the length of the fish, violating the consistency property. Furthermore, comparing <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> between species is problematic because both species would need to exhibit isometric growth for the comparison to be valid. Because of these limitations, Fulton’s condition factor should be avoided.</p>
</div>
<div id="lecrens-relative-condition-factor" class="section level3">
<h3>LeCren’s Relative Condition Factor</h3>
<p>The relative condition factor, introduced by <span class="citation">Le Cren (1951)</span>, is calculated with</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Kn = \frac{W}{W&#39;} \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(W&#39;\)</span> is the predicted length-specific mean weight for the population under study [<span class="citation">Blackwell et al. (2000)</span>}. The average <span class="math inline">\(Kn\)</span> across all lengths and species is 1.0 [<span class="citation">Anderson and Neumann (1996)</span>}. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(Kn\)</span> is consistent across lengths. <span class="citation">Bolger and Connolly (1989)</span>, however, show that <span class="math inline">\(Kn\)</span> comparisons are restricted to species or regions that have the same slope (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>) in the length-weight relationship. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(W&#39;\)</span> is generally predicted from length-weight equations developed for a population (perhaps from several years of data) or for a region.</p>
</div>
<div id="relative-weight" class="section level3">
<h3>Relative Weight</h3>
<p>The relative weight, introduced by <span class="citation">Wege and Anderson (1978)</span>, is calculated with</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Wr = \frac{W}{Ws}*100 \quad \quad \text{(1)} \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(Ws\)</span> is a ``standard weight’’ for fish of the same length. In simplistic terms, a standard weight equation for a particular species is a length-weight relationship designed to predict the 75th percentile<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> mean weight for a given value of length.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Standard weight equations have been developed for a wide variety of species.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> It should be noted that the standard weight equations have been developed for either metric or English unit measurements but that the <span class="math inline">\(log_{10}\)</span> rather than the <span class="math inline">\(log_{e}\)</span> transformation is used. <span class="citation">Blackwell et al. (2000)</span> suggest that regional or population-specific <span class="math inline">\(Ws\)</span> equations should NOT be developed. If regional or population-specific analysis is desired then <span class="math inline">\(Kn\)</span> should be used.</p>
<p>Recent trends, following the work of <span class="citation">Gerow et al. (2005)</span>, have resulted in standard weight equations that are quadratic rather than linear. Examples of the use of quadratic standard weight equations can be found in <span class="citation">Ogle and Winfield (2009)</span> and <span class="citation">Cooney and Kwak (2010)</span>. While use of these types of standard weight equations is not illustrated in this vignette, their use is a simple and straightforward modification of what is demonstrated here.</p>
<p>The relative weight measure has become the most popular measure of condition <span class="citation">(Blackwell et al. 2000)</span>. This popularity is partly due to the fact that relative weight summaries have been used as a surrogate measure of the general “health” of the fish (<span class="citation">Brown and Murphy (1991)</span>, <span class="citation">Neumann and Murphy (1992)</span>, <span class="citation">Jonas et al. (1996)</span>, <span class="citation">Brown and Murphy (2004)</span>, <span class="citation">Kaufman et al. (2007)</span>, <span class="citation">Rennie and Verdon (2008)</span>}; but also see <span class="citation">Copeland et al. (2008)</span>) as well as the environment (<span class="citation">Liao et al. (1995)</span>, <span class="citation">Blackwell et al. (2000)</span>, <span class="citation">Rennie and Verdon (2008)</span>). Thus, relative weight summaries may be used as an indirect means for evaluating ecological relationships and the effects of management strategies (<span class="citation">Murphy et al. (1991)</span>, <span class="citation">Blackwell et al. (2000)</span>). In addition, <span class="citation">Murphy et al. (1990)</span> found the distributions of <span class="math inline">\(Wr\)</span> values to typically be symmetric (but not normal). Because t-tests and analysis of variance tests are relatively robust to departures from normality, as long as the distribution is symmetric, typical parametric inferential statistics can be used with <span class="math inline">\(Wr\)</span> values.</p>
<p>It should be noted, though, that Gerow (<span class="citation">Gerow et al. (2004)</span>, <span class="citation">Gerow et al. (2005)</span>, and <span class="citation">Gerow (2010)</span>) has been critical of the idea that traditionally developed standard weight equations produce relative weight values that are not dependent on the length of the fish.</p>

<div id="comparisons-among-length-categories" class="section level3">
<h3>Comparisons Among Length Categories</h3>
<p>A measure of overall condition using <span class="math inline">\(Wr\)</span> should not be computed without first determining if the <span class="math inline">\(Wr\)</span> values differ across fish lengths <span class="citation">(Blackwell et al. 2000)</span>. In particular, <span class="citation">Murphy et al. (1991)</span> suggested that <span class="math inline">\(Wr\)</span> values should first be summarized within the usual five-cell length categories of <span class="citation">Gabelhouse (1984)</span>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Use of the five-cell model can be problematic at times because of small sample sizes in the larger length categories. Thus, other authors have summarized by 25- or 50-mm length categories. The mean <span class="math inline">\(Wr\)</span> values in the length categories are then tested with analysis of variance methods to determine if differences exist among the length categories. Adjacent length categories that are statistically equal can then be pooled together. If no statistical differences among categories exist, then all length categories can be pooled and an overall measure of condition for the population can be computed. Relative weights should be reported as whole numbers <span class="citation">(Blackwell et al. 2000)</span>.</p>
