1. Read [Experimental Analysis of a Reduced Daily Bluegill Limit in Minnesota (Jacobson, 2005)](Jacobson_2005_BGBagLimits.pdf) and be prepared to discuss the following items in class.
    * What is the described relationship between fishing effort and size-at-maturity and size of Bluegills?
    * What hypothesis led to this study?
    * What bag limit was used?  How did the author arrive at this value?
    * Describe the experimental setup?  What are the response variables?
    * What was the specific test of significance in this experiment?
    * Interpret the results in Figure 1, Table 3, and Table 4.
    * Why did the bag limits “work” in some lakes but not others?
    * What else does the author want to know about anglers to set more reduced bag limits?
    * What are (at least three) take home messages from this reading?
