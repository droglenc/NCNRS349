1. Read Section 9.1 in *Introductory Fisheries Analyses with R* and consider the items below.
    * What does a "1" in a capture history data format represent?
    * What does a "0" in a capture history data format represent?
    * How many "0"s and "1"s will there be for an individual fish in data that is in a capture history format?
    * What do you know about a fish that has "011001" as its capture history?
    * If there were five sampling occasions, fish with which capture history formats would be counted to determine the total number of fish that were captured on the third sampling occasion?
