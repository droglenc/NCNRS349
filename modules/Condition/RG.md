1. Read Chapter 8 in *Introductory Fisheries Analyses with R* and [these notes](BKG.html) and consider the items below.
    * What are the three most common condition indices?
    * What is the formula for Fulton's condition factor?
    * What fundamental assumption about fish "growth" does Fulton's condition factor make? Why does this make this metric largely useless?
    * What is the formula for the relative condition factor of LeCren?
    * What is the primary limitation for using the relative condition factor?
    * What is the formula for a relative weight?
    * What possible relationship with condition should be checked for before computing an overall measure of condition for a stock of fish?
    * What R function is used to find the coefficients of the standard weight equation for a given fish species? What are the arguments to this function?
    * What statistical test can be used to compare mean relative weights among Gabelhouse length categories?
1. Read [Pope and Kruse (2007) Sections 10.1, 10.3, 10.6, & 10.7](Pope-Kruse-2007_10_1367.pdf) (*the complete chapter [is here](../Weight-Length/Pope-Kruse-2007.pdf)*) and consider the items below.
    * What is "condition" a measure of?
    * Condition indices must control for what confounding effect? Put this into your own words.
    * Why is measuring fish condition important to a fisheries scientist?
    * What are the three most common condition indices?
    * What is the formula for Fulton's condition factor?
    * What fundamental assumption about fish "growth" does Fulton's condition factor make? Why does this make this metric largely useless?
    * What is the formula for the relative condition factor of LeCren?
    * What is the primary limitation for using the relative condition factor?
    * What is the formula for a relative weight?
    * What value of W<sub>r</sub> represents fish in "good condition"?
    * What abiotic and biotic factors have been found to be related to fish condition?
