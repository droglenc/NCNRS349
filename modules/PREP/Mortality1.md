1. What is "mortality"?
1. Define A, C<sub>t</sub>, C<sub>t+1</sub>, and Z.
1. What is the formula for computing annual total mortality from catches that are separated by a single year?
1. What is the formula for computing instantaneous total mortality from catches that are separated by a single year?
1. How is A calculated from Z?
1. Why is Z almost always converted to A?
1. Describe the difference between longitudinal and cross-sectional catch-at-age data.
1. What must be true for a vector of consecutive catches-at-age to be equal when extracted from longitudinal and cross-sectional data.
1. What is the characteristic shape of catch curve data? Specifically, identify three regions on the curve.
1. Why does the catch curve have the shape described in the previous question?
1. What is the equation for the "catch-curve" model (that shows how catch is related to time)? Show how this equation can be linearized.
1. How is Z estimated from catch-curve data?
1. What R function can be used to efficiently perform a catch curve estimate of Z?
1. What R function is used to extract the estimates of Z and A from this function?
1. What R function is used to extract confidence intervals for Z and A from this function?
1. What is a weighted catch-curve analysis?
