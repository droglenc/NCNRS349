1. Draw a plot of abundance (numbers of organisms) against time that represents logistic growth.
1. What do N<sub>t</sub>, N<sub>t+1</sub>, N<sub>0</sub>, r, and K represent in the exponential and logistic growth functions/models.
1. What are the fundamental differences in assumptions underlying the exponential and logistic growth functions/models.
1. What is the difference between a discrete and a continuous function/model?
1. Describe a (fish-related) situation where the exponential function/model may adequately represent population growth?
