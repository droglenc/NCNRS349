subtitle: Northern Pike Invasion

----

In class we will consider the effect that an invasion of Northern Pike (*Esox lucius*) has on fish populations that were already present in the lake.[^1] To prepare for this exercise, you should research[^2] answers to these questions:

* What is the typical diet of Northern Pike?
* Do Northern Pike select prey by species, size, both, or neither?
* What impact does Northern Pike predation have on populations of their prey?

In class, we will work through the questions described [in these slides](NOPInvasion_Student.pptx).
