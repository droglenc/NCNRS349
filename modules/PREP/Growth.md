1. Define L<sub>&#8734;</sub>, K, t<sub>0</sub>, L<sub>0</sub>, &omega;, L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>, and L<sub>3</sub> (**be very specific with these definitions, possibly including what these items are NOT**.)
1. What data is required to fit a VBGF?
1. Write the equations for the typical, original, Schnute, Gallucci and Quinn, and Francis parametrizations of the von Bertlanffy Growth Function (VBGF).
1. How do the fits of the various VBGF paramegerizatons differ?
1. What are the assumptions required to fit a VBGF with nonlinear regression?
