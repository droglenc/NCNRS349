Suppose that a researcher captured and individually marked 75 fish on day 1.  Two days later, a total of 100 fish were captured of which 25 were marked.

1. How many columns are in the capture history matrix?
1. How many rows are in the capture history matrix?
1. What does a row for an individual fish in the capture history look like for ...
    1. A fish captured in both samples?
    1. A fish captured in the first but not the second sample?
    1. A fish captured in the second but not the first sample?
    1. A fish captured in neither sample?

## Example #2

A researcher sampled a stream weekly for 8 weeks.

1. How many columns are in the capture history matrix?
1. How many rows are in the capture history matrix?
1. What does a row for an individual fish in the capture history look like for ...
    1. A fish marked in week 2 and recaptured in weeks 7 & 8?
    1. marked in week 3 and then not seen again?
    1. marked in the first week, captured again in week 3, and captured again in week 5, but not again?
