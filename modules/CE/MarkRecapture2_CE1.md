## Summarizing Assumption Violations
Use your results from [the class exercise](../CEX/MarkRecapture2_CEX1){:target="_blank"} to provide answers to the following questions.

1. Which assumption violations allow the biologist to still reliably estimate the *initial* population abundance?
1. Which assumption violations allow the biologist to still reliably estimate the *final* population abundance?
1. Which assumption violations allow the biologist to still reliably estimate *both* the initial and final population abundances?
1. Which assumption violation does the initial population abundance seem most sensitive to?
1. What are three things you can do when performing a mark-recapture study that will minimize violating these assumptions?
