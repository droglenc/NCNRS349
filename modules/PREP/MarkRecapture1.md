Read [this](NOTES/MarkRecapture1){:target="_blank"} and [Section 8.3.1 in Hayes *et al.*](RESOURCES/Hayesetal-2007-Sect8-3part.pdf){:target="_blank"} and answer the following questions. [*Note that the reading in the next section may also be helpful for some of these questions.*]

1. Who popularized the use of single-census mark-recapture to estimate abundance in fisheries?
1. What would n<sub>.1</sub> represent? What is an alternative symbol for this value?
1. How many sample are taken to estimate abundance with the Petersen method?
1. Define N, M, n, and m.
1. What equation is used to estimate N in the original Petersen method?
1. What is the fundamental assumption that leads to the derivation of the equation used to estimate N with the Petersen method?
1. What are the rules for determining which distribution is used to construct a confidence interval for N?
1. Why did Chapman modify Petersen's equation?
1. What is the equation for the Chapman Modification of the Petersen method?
