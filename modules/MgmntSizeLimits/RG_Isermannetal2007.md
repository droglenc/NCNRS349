1. Read [Yellow Perch in South Dakota: Population Variability and Predicted Effects of Creel Limit Reductions and Minimum Length Limits (Isermann *et al.*, 2007)](Isermannetal_2007_YEPBagSizeLimits.pdf) and be prepared to discuss the following items in class.
    * How are most Yellow Perch fisheries managed?
    * What two characteristics of Yellow Perch populations impact management options?
    * What were the stated objectives of this study?
    * Specifically, what did the authors do in this study?
    * What were the response variables?
    * Explain, in lay terms, the four criterion they used to interpet their model results.
    * Interpret Tables 3 and 5.
    * Why did minimum length limits result in improved age- and size-structures but not in increased yields and harvests?
    * How does the relative proportional contribution to annual mortality impact the probability of success for minimum length limits?
    * What are (at least three) take home messages?
