## Inch Lake Largemouth Bass
[Inch Lake](http://dnr.wi.gov/lakes/lakepages/LakeDetail.aspx?wbic=2764300&page=facts) is a 12.5 ha inland lake in northern Wisconsin that has been managed as catch-and-release for all species since 2006. Researchers at Northland College have monitored fish populations in Inch Lake since 2007. The total lengths (**inches**) and weights (**g**) for subsamples of several species of fish collected from Inch Lake in May of 2007 and 2008 are recorded in InchLake2.csv ([Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/FSAdata/master/data-raw/InchLake2.csv) / [meta](http://derekogle.com/fishR/data/data-html/InchLake2.html)).

Restrict these data to only Largemouth Bass captured in 2008 to do the following.

1. Compute the mean relative weight for each Gabelhouse length category.
1. Construct a plot of the mean relative weight, with confidence intervals, for each Gabelhouse length category.
1. Determine if the mean relative weight differs among Gabelhouse length categories.
