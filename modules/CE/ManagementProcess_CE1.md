You are assigned one (or part of one) of the following fisheries management plans.

* **Grueneis and Sims** -- [Leech Lake Management Plan, 2016-20](http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/fisheries/largelakes/leech/leechmp.pdf){:target="_blank"} -- Focus on Yellow Perch.
* [Fisheries Management Plan for the Minnesota Waters of Lake Superior (2016)](http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/publications/fisheries/special_reports/181.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
    * **Maier and Scott** -- Focus on Lean Lake Trout (Chapter 6)

* **Goodson & Schmit** -- [Fish Species Management Plan for Alligator Gar in Illinois](https://www.dnr.illinois.gov/news/documents/algplan.pdf){:target="_blank"}

These plans may use slightly different terminology than what was introduced by [Krueger and Decker (2010)](KruegerDecker_2010_Process.pdf){:target="_blank"} and discussed in class. Thus, you should, in two pages or less, ...

1. **Show**, **with specific evidences**, how the terminology used in your management plan is related to that used by Krueger and Decker (2010). [In other words, specifically show how the words in the management plan equate to the words used by Krueger and Decker (2010).]
1. **Demonstrate**, **with specific evidences**, the goals, objectives, problem identification, actions, evaluation, and information base of Krueger and Decker (2010) with one full example from your management plan. [In other words, what can you extract from your management plan that demonstrates the concepts of Krueger and Decker (2010).]
1. Provide a **thoughtful** critique, **with specific evidences**, of your management plan in terms of what Krueger and Decker (2010) suggest for how goals, objectives, problems, actions, and evaluations should be defined. [In other words, do you think the management plan adequately follows the concepts laid out by Krueger and Decker (2010)?]
