Read [this](NOTES/Mortality1) and answer the following questions. [*Note that the readings in the next sections may also be helpful for some of these questions.*]

1. Define A, C<sub>t</sub>, C<sub>t+1</sub>, and Z.
1. What is the formula for computing annual mortality from catches that are separated by a single year?
1. Describe the difference between longitudinal and cross-sectional catch-at-age data.
1. What must be true for a vector of consecutive catches-at-age to be equal when extracted from longitudinal and cross-sectional data.
1. What is the equation for the "catch-curve" model (that shows how catch is related to time)? Show how this equation can be linearized.
1. How is Z estimated from catch-curve data?
1. How is A estimated from Z?
1. What is the characteristic shape of catch curve data? Specifically, identify three regions on the curve.
1. Why does the catch curve have the shape described in the previous question?
