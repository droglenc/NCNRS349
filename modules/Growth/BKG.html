<p>Growth of individual organisms within a population is generally characterized by an expression which is representative of individual growth of an “average” animal in the population. Individual growth is treated as an increase in either length or weight with increasing age. Several functions (or models) have been used to model the mean length or weight of fishes. One function, the von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF), is the most popular and is the focus of this module.</p>

<h1>Size-at-Age Data</h1>
<p>The raw data for size-at-age modeling consists of the measurement of size, either length or weight, and the assignment of age to individual fish at the time the fish was captured. This is called <em>length-at-capture</em>, <em>weight-at-capture</em>, and <em>age-at-capture</em> data. An example<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> of this type of data for length and age is shown in Table 1-Left and in Figure 1.</p>

<p>Historical methods for estimating the parameters of growth models used the <em>average</em> length or weight at each observed age for the sample (Table 1-Right) rather than the original data recorded for each individual. The historical methods should no longer be used because high-speed computers can easily perform the calculations or iterations necessary for fitting the growth models to individual at-capture data. In addition, the historical methods lost important information about individual variability. The historical method is carefully discussed in <span class="citation">Ricker (1975)</span>.</p>
<p>It is also common to use “back-calculation” techniques to reconstruct data for growth analyses. This type of data is called <em>retrospective size-at-age data</em> <span class="citation">(Jones 2000)</span>. Growth data generated in this way is generally inappropriate for the simple modeling techniques developed in this vignette because the back-calculated measurements are serially correlated (i.e., the techniques described here require independent observations). The problems created by serially-correlated data and techniques for handling serially-correlated data are described in <span class="citation">Jones (2000)</span>.</p>

<h1>“Typical” von Bertalanffy Growth Model</h1>
<div id="the-model-and-parameters" class="section level2">
<h2>The Model and Parameters</h2>
<p>There are many versions or parameterizations of the VBGF (see <a href="#other-parameterizations-of-the-vbgf">this section</a>). The most common version is due to <span class="citation">Beverton (1954)</span> and <span class="citation">Beverton and Holt (1957)</span>, who modified the original version introduced by von Bertalanffy <span class="citation">(Cailliet et al. 2006)</span>. This model will be termed the “typical” version of the VBGF throughout this module. The typical VBGF is represented by<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="math">\[ E[L|t] = L_{\infty}\left(1-e^{-K(t-t_{0})}\right) \quad \quad \text{(1)}  \]</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(E[L|t]\)</span> is the expected or average length at time (or age) t,</li>
<li><span class="math">\(L_{\infty}\)</span> is the asymptotic average length,</li>
<li><span class="math">\(K\)</span> is the so-called Brody growth rate coefficient (units are yr<span class="math">\(^{-1}\)</span>), and</li>
<li><span class="math">\(t_{0}\)</span> is a modeling artificat that is said to represent the time or age when the average length was zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>The parameters of Equation 1 have strict meanings that have been misunderstood in past work. The following items address some of these misunderstandings.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math">\(L_{\infty}\)</span> is <em>not</em> the maximum length of the animal. Rather <span class="math">\(L_{\infty}\)</span> is the asymptote for the model of <em>average</em> length-at-age <span class="citation">(Francis 1988)</span>. As with any average, some individuals will be larger than average; thus, some animals will be larger than <span class="math">\(L_{\infty}\)</span>. This is illustrated in Figure 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Furthermore, <span class="citation">Francis (1988)</span> argues that <span class="math">\(L_{\infty}\)</span> only has meaning in fish populations where “mortality is low enough to allow fish to reach an age at which the mean length (virtually) ceases to increase.”</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math">\(K\)</span> is <em>not</em> a growth rate <span class="citation">(Ricker 1975)</span>. The units of <span class="math">\(K\)</span> can be seen by algebraically solving Equation 1 for <span class="math">\(K\)</span>,</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math">\[ 1-\frac{E[L|t]}{L_{\infty}} = -e^{-K(t-t_{o})} \]</span> <span class="math">\[ log\left(\frac{1-E[L|t]}{L_{\infty}}\right) = -K(t-t_{o}) \]</span> <span class="math">\[ K = \frac{log\left(\frac{L_{\infty}-E[L|t]}{L_{\infty}}\right)}{t-t_{o}} \]</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>
to notice that the units in the numerator disappear. Thus, the units of <span class="math">\(K\)</span> are in <span class="math">\(time^{-1}\)</span> rather than a change in length for a unit time as required by a growth rate.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span class="citation">Schnute and Fournier (1980)</span> offer two related interpretations of the meaning of <span class="math">\(K\)</span>. First, <span class="math">\(K\)</span> “measures the exponential rate of approach to the asymptotic size.” Second, the value <span class="math">\(e^{-K}\)</span> is “the fixed fraction by which the annual growth increment is multiplied each year.” This last definition is seen by the relation</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math">\[ E[L|t=i+2]-E[L|t=i+1] = e^{-K}(E[L|t=i+1]-E[L|t=i]) \quad \quad \text{(2)}  \]</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>
where, because <span class="math">\(K&gt;0\)</span>, the quantity <span class="math">\(e^{-K}\)</span> is a decimal. Thus, each succeeding growth increment is a constant fraction of the current growth increment indicating that growth slows as the fish gets older.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math">\(t_{0}\)</span>, despite its definition above, is a modeling artifact and not a biological parameter <span class="citation">(Schnute and Fournier 1980)</span>. The <span class="math">\(t_{0}\)</span> parameter is included in Equation 1 to adjust or “correct” the model for the initial size of the animal as most of the models do not pass through the origin. This is illustrated in Figure 2. <span class="citation">Beverton (1954)</span> said “It must be remembered that the constant <span class="math">\(t_{0}\)</span> is largely artificial, insofar as it defines the age at which the organism would be of zero length if it grew throughout life with the same pattern of growth as in the post-larval stage.” In addition, <span class="citation">Beverton and Holt (1957)</span> stated that “in practice, the constant <span class="math">\(t_{0}\)</span> must be regarded as quite artificial.”</p></li>
<li><p>The estimation and interpretation of <span class="math">\(t_{0}\)</span> is further complicated by the fact that the value of <span class="math">\(t_{0}\)</span> is generally an extrapolation <span class="citation">(Francis 1988)</span> – e.g., Figure 2.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math">\(L_{\infty}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(K\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(t_{0}\)</span> are highly related (or correlated). This can be seen in the solution for <span class="math">\(K\)</span> above where <span class="math">\(K\)</span> depends on the values of <span class="math">\(L_{\infty}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(t_{0}\)</span>. For example, with all else held constant, <span class="math">\(K\)</span> will be larger for smaller values of <span class="math">\(L_{\infty}\)</span>. This dependency among parameters causes problems in model fitting and interpretation <span class="citation">(Ratkowsky 1986)</span>. Some of the other VBGF parameterizations (see <a href="#other-parameterizations-of-the-vbgf">this section</a>) have parameters that are much less correlated.</p></li>

<h1>Other Parameterizations of the VBGF</h1>
<div id="the-models-and-their-parameters" class="section level2">
<h2>The Models and Their Parameters</h2>
<p>A model can often be cast into a different parameterization where the model is functionally the same – i.e., predictions are exactly the same – but it has different parameters. Different parameterizations of models are created for a variety of reasons but two important reasons are that the re-parameterized model (i) has parameters for which the interpretation meets some need and (ii) has parameters that are less correlated. Each parameterization can ultimately be shown to be equivalent via albegra. The VBGF has been cast in at least five different parameterizations, each of which is discussed in this section.</p>
<div id="original-model-parameterization" class="section level4">

<div id="gallucci-and-quinn-1979-parameterization" class="section level4">
<h4>Gallucci and Quinn (1979) Parameterization</h4>
<p><span class="citation">Gallucci and <span>Quinn II</span> (1979)</span> noted that comparisons of “growth” between two groups should involve both <span class="math">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math">\(L_{\infty}\)</span>. However, because of the generally high correlation between these two parameters, simultaneous hypothesis tests of these two parameters are compromised and difficult to interpret. To aid comparison between two groups, <span class="citation">Gallucci and <span>Quinn II</span> (1979)</span> introduced a new parameter, <span class="math">\(\omega=KL_{\infty}\)</span> which, by solving this quantity for <span class="math">\(L_{\infty}\)</span> and substituting into Equation 1, yields yet another reparameterization of the VBGF,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ E[L|t] = \frac{\omega}{K}\left(1-e^{-K(t-t_{0})}\right) \quad \quad \text{(4)}  \]</span></p>
<p><span class="citation">Gallucci and <span>Quinn II</span> (1979)</span> state that <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span> can be thought of as a growth rate because the units are in length-per-time and, in fact, it is representative of the growth rate near <span class="math">\(t_{o}\)</span>. Furthermore, they claim that <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span> is the appropriate parameter to use when comparing populations because of its statistical robustness.</p>
</div>
<div id="mooij-et-al.-1999-parameterization" class="section level4">
<h4>Mooij <em>et al.</em> (1999) Parameterization</h4>
<p><span class="citation">Mooij et al. (1999)</span> applied the same concept as <span class="citation">Gallucci and <span>Quinn II</span> (1979)</span> to Equation 3 rather than Equation 1 to yield the following parameterization,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ E[L|t] = L_{\infty}-(L_{\infty}-L_{0})e^{-\frac{\omega}{L_{\infty}}t} \quad \quad \text{(5)}  \]</span></p>
<p>The parameters of this model are interpreted as before with the exception that <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span> is representative of the growth rate near <span class="math">\(L_{0}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="schnute-parameterization" class="section level4">
<h4>Schnute Parameterization</h4>
<p>All previous parameterizations have two major difficulties – (1) highly correlated parameters and (2) some parameters that are largely extrapolations (the “positions” of <span class="math">\(L_\infty\)</span>, <span class="math">\(L_{0}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(t_{0}\)</span> are rarely represented in the data). The VBGF parameterizations shown in this, and the next, section are largely based on “expected values” at known ages and, thus, largely alleviate these difficulties <span class="citation">(Ratkowsky 1986)</span>. The so-called “Schnute” parameterization (from <span class="citation">Quinn II and Deriso (1999)</span>) of the VBGF is,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ E[L|t] = L_{1} + (L_{3}-L_{1})\frac{1-e^{-K(t-t_{1})}}{1-e^{-K(t_{3}-t_{1})}} \quad \quad \text{(6)}  \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(L_{1}\)</span> is the average length at the youngest age, <span class="math">\(t_{1}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(L_{3}\)</span> is the average length at the oldest age, <span class="math">\(t_{3}\)</span>, <em>in the sample</em>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this parameterization is not more or less parsimonious then any of the previous parameterizations as it still has three parameters – <span class="math">\(L_{1}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(L_{3}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(K\)</span> (note that <span class="math">\(t_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(t_{3}\)</span> are constants). However, it does have two major advantages over the previous parameterizations. First, the parameters in this parameterization are less correlated than the parameters in other parameterizations (<span class="citation">Gallucci and <span>Quinn II</span> (1979)</span> and see <a href="#parameterization-comparisons">this section</a>) and, thus, more stable. Second, this parameterization is directly comparable to the general growth model developed by <span class="citation">Schnute (1981)</span>. The major drawback of this parameterization is that comparison to results in the literature or from previous studies is difficult, as the typical parameterization is far more prevalent. <span class="citation">Schnute and Fournier (1980)</span> did show, however, that the point estimate of <span class="math">\(L_{\infty}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(t_{0}\)</span> can be obtained from the parameters in the Schnute parameterization as follows,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ L_{\infty} = \frac{L_{3}-L_{1}e^{-K(t_{3}-t_{1})}}{1-e^{-K(t_{3}-t_{1})}} \]</span> <span class="math">\[ t_{0} = t_{1} + \frac{1}{K}ln\left(\frac{L_{3}-L_{1}}{L_{3}-L_{1}e^{-K(t_{3}-t_{1})}}\right) \]</span></p>
<p>A common mistake in the interpretation of the Schnute parameterization is to equate <span class="math">\(L_{2}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(L_{\infty}\)</span>. However, <span class="math">\(L_{2} \neq L_{\infty}\)</span> as <span class="math">\(L_{\infty}\)</span> is the average size at the theoretical maximum age and <span class="math">\(L_{2}\)</span> is the average size at the maximum age *in the sample}. Thus, <span class="math">\(L_{2}\leq L_{\infty}\)</span> because the maximum age in the sample is either less than or equal to the theoretical maximum age (Figure 4).</p>

<div id="francis-1988-parameterization" class="section level4">
<h4>Francis (1988) Parameterization</h4>
<p><span class="citation">Francis (1988)</span> provided yet another parameterization of the VBGF in his paper comparing the fit of VBGFs to length-at-age data and to tag-recapture data. His basic argument was that the meanings of <span class="math">\(L_{\infty}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(K\)</span> depend on which type of data (and corresponding model) is being fit and that this is an undesirable property. He proposed the following parameterization as a correction to this problem,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ E[L|t] = L_{1} + \left(L_{3} - L_{1}\right)\frac{1-r^{2\frac{t-t_{1}}{t_{3}-t_{1}}}}{1-r^2} \quad \quad \text{(8)}  \]</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ r = \frac{L_{3}-L_{2}}{L_{2}-L_{1}} \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(L_{1}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(L_{2}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(L_{3}\)</span> are the mean lengths at ages <span class="math">\(t_{1}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(t_{2}\)</span>,and <span class="math">\(t_{3}\)</span>, respectivly. The <span class="math">\(t_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(t_{3}\)</span> are arbitrary reference ages (and <span class="math">\(t_{2}\)</span> is half-way between each) but are generally a relatively young (i.e., <span class="math">\(t_{1}\)</span>) and old (i.e., <span class="math">\(t_{3}\)</span>) age. Note that <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is used to simplify the presentation and is not a new parameter. The resultant parameters from this model are effectively the predicted mean lengths-at-age for the three chosen ages (Figure 5).</p>

Note that the arbitrary ages chosen were <span class="math">\(t_{1}\)</span>=2 and <span class="math">\(t_{3}\)</span>=9.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="citation">Francis (1988)</span> showed that point estimates of the typical parameters could be derived from these modified parameters as follows,</p>

<h2>Parameterization Comparisons</h2>
<p>As noted previously, the different parameterizations of the VBGF are the same model with different parameters (Figure 6). Estimates of parameters that appear in more than one of the parameterizations will be the same among the parameterizations (Table 2). The parameterizations based on expected values (i.e., Schnute and Francis) will generally require fewer iterations to converge when fitting and will result in lower correlations among parameter estimates (Table 2).</p>

<p>Figure 6: Fits of the typical (blue), Schnute (red), and Francis (green) parameterizations of the VBGF to size-at-age Atlantic Croaker data (auto-generated starting values were used for all parameterizations). Note that the results of all fits are identical and, thus, the fitted lines are directly on top of each other. Different colors and different line widths were used to illustrate this point but may not be readily apparent on the screen or printed page.</p>
