1. How is C/f defined (i.e., what is the equation for C/f)? Define all terms in this definition/equation.
1. Describe the conceptual relationship between C/f and N.
1. What are the assumptions that underlay the conceptual relationship between C/f and N? Identify which of these is the "primary" assumption.
1. What are four common uses of C/f data? [*from Hubert and Fabrizio*]
1. Describe how measures of effort may differ between types of gears. Include specific examples for common types of gears such as gillnets, fyke nets, seines, and electrofishing. [*from Hubert and Fabrizio*]
1. What has a large impact on estimates of C/f? Describe two ways in which fisheries biologists attempt to mitigate this impact. [*from Hubert et al*]
1. Describe three situations that may cause the relationship between N and C/f to be "curved." [*from Hubert et al*]
1. Describe "hyperdepletion" and "hyperstability."
