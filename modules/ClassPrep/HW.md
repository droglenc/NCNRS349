1. Define intra-specific and inter-specific competition.
1. Give examples of substantive three abiotic and three biotic factors that may impact fish or fish populations.
1. Briefly describe (not just list) the three subfamilies of Salmonidae. Additionally, explain differences between the *Oncorhynchus*, *Salmo* and *Salvelinus* genera. From this you should be able to explain how the following fishes differ and are related (behaviorally, ecologically, systematically): Chinook Salmon, King Salmon, Coho Salmon, Silver Salmon, Chum Salmon, Dog Salmon, Pink Salmon, Sockeye Salmon, Red Salmon, Rainbow Trout, Steelhead, Atlantic Salmon, Brown Trout, Brook Trout, Lake Trout, Splake, Arctic Char, Lake Whitefish, Cisco, Lake Herring, Bloater, and Kiyi.
