Re-read Section 7.3.4 in [Regulating Harvest (Isermann and Paukert, 2010)](RESOURCES/IsermannPaukert_2010_HarvestRegulations.pdf) and consider the following items.

1. Differentiate between minimum, maximum, protected slot, and harvest slot length limits.
1. What are typical possible responses of a fishery to the implementation of length limits?
1. Describe population characteristics (density, growth, etc.) for when a protected slot or a harvest slot should be implemented.

Read [The Role of Size Limits in Walleye Management (Brousseau and Armstrong (1987)](RESOURCES/BrousseauArmstrong_1987_WAELengthLimits.pdf) and consider the following items.

{:start="4"}
1. What are five potential objectives for implementing size limits on Walleye fisheries?  Which is most common?
1. Describe population characteristics (density, growth, etc.) for when a minimum, protected slot, or maximum length limit should be implemented.
1. Explain why the author suggests that length limits should be applied on a lake-specific rather than state-wide basis.  Why is this seldom followed in practice?
1. List and describe factors that may create obstacles to the success of length limit regulations?

Read [Managing Bass Fisheries with Size Limits (Allen)](RESOURCES/Allen_Size_Limits.pdf) and consider the following items.

{:start="8"}
1. What are the three factors that typically determine the success or failure of a length limit?  Define each.  Explain how each of these items may affect your determination to use one of the length limits or not? [For example, which of these items or combination of these items generally leads to a successful application of a protected slot length limit?]
1. Describe how the author's beliefs have about strict catch-and-release have changed over time.
1. How has the strict catch-and-release ethic of most black bass anglers affected manager's ability to manage fish poplations?

Read [Weighing the Effects of Length Limits (Gangl, 2013)](RESOURCES/Gangl_SizeLimits.pdf) and consider the following items.

{:start="11"}
1. What are the factors that typically determine the success or failure of a length limit?  Explain how each of these items may affect your determination to use one of the length limits or not?
1. What other considerations led the biologists to not implement length limits in the areas considered?

----

Read [Bass Length Limits (Oklahoma Wildlife Department)](RESOURCES/OK_bass_length_limits.pdf) and consider the following items.

{:start="13"}
1. Compare "selective harvest" to "catch and release."
1. Describe population characteristics (density, growth, etc.) from when a minimum or protected slot should be implemented.
