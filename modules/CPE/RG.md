1. Read [Boxes 6.3 & 6.4 in Hubert *et al.* (2012)](Hubertetal-2012-BOXES.pdf) (the complete chapter [is here](http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1110&context=ncfwrustaff)) and consider the items below.[^1]
    * What is C/f called?
    * How is C/f defined (i.e., what is the equation for C/f)? Define all terms in this definition/equation.
    * Describe the conceptual relationship between C/f and N?
    * What are the assumptions that underlay the conceptual relationship between C/f and N? Identify which of these is the "primary" assumption.
    * What has a large impact on estimates of C/f? Describe two ways in which fisheries biologists attempt to mitigate this impact.
    * Describe three situations that may cause the relationship between N and C/f to be "curved."
    * Describe "hyperdepletion" and "hyperstability."
1. Read [Section 7.1 in Hubert & Fabrizio (2007)](HubertFabrizio-2007-Sect7-1.pdf) (the complete chapter [is here](HubertFabrizio-2007.pdf)) and consider the items below.[^1]
    * What is C/f called?
    * How is C/f defined (i.e., what is the equation for C/f)? Define all terms in this definition/equation.
    * Describe how measures of effort may different between types of gears. Include specific examples for common types of gears such as gillnets, fyke nets, seines, and electrofishing.
    * Define "a stock." Why is this important when considering C/f data?
    * What are four common uses of C/f data?
    * Describe the conceptual relationship between C/f and N?
    * What are the assumptions that underlay the conceptual relationship between C/f and N?
    * Critically assess the assumption of "constant catchability."
    * Describe "hyperdepletion" and "hyperstability."
1. Read the ["Problems with cpue data" section in Maunder *et al.* (2006)](http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/63/8/1373.full.pdf) and consider the items below.
    * Describe the conceptual relationship between CPUE and N?
    * Describe four things that cause q to change over time in a commercial fishery. [*Don't just list these items, provide a description.*]
