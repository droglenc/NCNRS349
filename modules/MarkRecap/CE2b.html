<h2>Understanding Assumption Violations in Mark-Recapture Analyses</h2>
<p><img src="http://derekogle.com/NCNRS349/img/computer-1.jpg" alt="Simulations" class="img-right"> The analytical methodology for the Petersen family of mark-recapture methods for estimating population abundance is based on the following five assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The population is physically (i.e., no immigration or emigration) and demographically (i.e., no recruitment or mortality) closed (so that <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is constant over the time of sampling).</li>
<li>Marks are neither lost nor missed.</li>
<li>Marked individuals returned to the population mix randomly with unmarked individuals.</li>
<li>All individuals within a sample have an equal probability of capture.</li>
<li>Individual behavior or vulnerability does not change after being marked.</li>
</ul>
<p>Violations of these assumptions may result in biased estimates of population abundance. The degree and direction of these biases vary depending on the type and degree of violation. An understanding of these biases is needed to actively guard against them and to inform careful interpretations of results. The effects of assumption violations on the estimates of abundance are the focus of this exercise.</p>

<div id="stating-your-expectations" class="section level4">
<h4>Stating Your Expectations</h4>
<p>The formula for the Petersen estimate of population abundance is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \widehat{N} = \frac{Mn}{m} \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{N}\)</span> is the estimated size of the population just prior to the first sample, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the number of fish from the first sample that were marked and returned to the population, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of fish in the second sample, and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the number of marked fish in the second sample. This formula can be rewrriten as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \widehat{N} = \frac{M}{\frac{m}{n}} \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\frac{m}{n}\)</span> is the proportion of fish in the second sample that were previously marked.</p>
<p>The reason for rewriting this formula in this way is that it can be seen that if <span class="math inline">\(\frac{m}{n}\)</span> is larger than it should be, then <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{N}\)</span> will be lower than it should be; i.e., <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is underestimated. Thus, if more marked fish appear in the second sample than expected, then <span class="math inline">\(\frac{m}{n}\)</span> will be too large and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> will be underestimated. Of course, the opposite is also true – if fewer marked fish appear in the second sample than expected, then <span class="math inline">\(\frac{m}{n}\)</span> will be too small and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> will be overestimated</p>
<p>So, assessing the effect of assumption violations on the estimate of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> reduces to determining if the violation would result in more or fewer marked fish in the second sample than would be expected.</p>

<h4>Questions III – Expectations from Violated Assumptions</h4>
<p>For each situation below, identify whether you think that the population abundance will be over, under, or accurately estimated by the Chapman modification method. Provide a reasoning for each of your answers.</p>
<ol>
<li>Marked individuals lose their mark (or tag) before the second sample.</li>
<li>Marked and unmarked individuals suffer mortality (at the same rate) before the second sample.</li>
<li>Marked, but not unmarked, individuals suffer mortality before the second sample.</li>
<li>Unmarked, but not marked, individuals suffer mortality before the second sample.</li>
<li>Individuals recruit (or migrate) into the population between the first and second samples.</li>
<li>Marked individuals show a higher catchability in the second sample (i.e., “trap happy”) compared to unmarked individuals.</li>
<li>Marked individuals show a lower catchability in the second sample (i.e., “trap shy”) compared to unmarked individuals.</li>
<li>Technicians do not notice some marked fish in the second sample.</li>
<li>Marked fish are released next to the nets used to take the second sample.</li>
</ol>
