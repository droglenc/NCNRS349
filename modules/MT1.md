The following are possible questions for the midterm exam.

- Define all symbols including:
    - N<sub>0</sub>, q, Z, F, M, A, S, u, v, m, n, C<sub>t</sub>, f<sub>t</sub>, N<sub>t</sub>, r
    - M,n,m from mark-recapture
- Describe a conceptual model of a stock (i.e., what things effect stock abundance and biomass)
- Write discrete and continuous population growth models and define terms.
-	Density-dependence – define, example graphs, example explanations (e.g., depletion of resources lead to increase mortality, decrease in fecundity, etc.)
-	Types of dynamics with different values of r in a discrete popn growth model.

-	What is the catch equation, define all aspects

-	Define CPE, why would we use it
-	What happens to q or N<sub>0</sub> estimates if mortality/recruitment exists.
-	What happens to Leslie model shape if catchability increases/decreases?
-	Interpret results from depletion() et al.
-	Four main assumptions of Leslie model and how do we try to make sure they are met.
-	Thoroughly discuss hyperstability and hyperdepletion?
-	What does Maunder argue are flaws with CPUE data.  Provide specific examples.

-	Why use Chapman vs. Petersen?
-	Perform a Chapman M/R calculation from raw values.
-	Assumptions, and what violations do to population estimates
-	Understand capture histories

-	Describe how the Leslie methods can be used to estimate population sizes.
-	Compute estimates of No and q from Leslie model regression results.
-	What are the assumptions of the Leslie methods?
-	Explain which assumption of depletion/removal methods is most commonly violated.  Why?

-	Compute an age-length key from a two-way table.
-	Identify proportions and number of fish that will be assigned a certain age from an age-length key according to the Isermann-Knight method.
-	Describe how an age-length-key is used in the Isermann-Knight method.
-	Describe why age-length-keys are used.

-	Describe difference between cross-sectional and longitudinal catch curves
-	Identify vectors of catch and ages from a matrix of catches-at-age for cross-sectional and longitudinal catch curves.
-	Assumptions? How does shape of catch-curve change if assumptions are violated?
