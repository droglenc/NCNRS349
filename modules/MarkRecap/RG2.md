1. Read [these notes](MarkRecap/BKG.html") and consider the items below.
    * Who popularized the use of single-census mark-recapture to estimate abundance in fisheries?
    * What would n<sub>.1..</sub> represent? What is an alternative symbol for this value?
    * Be prepared to discuss the sampling (i.e., how fish are handled, how data is recorded, how many sample are taken,etc.) required for estimating abundance with the Petersen method?
    * Define N, M, n, and m.
    * What equation is used to estimate N?
    * What is the fundamental assumption that leads to the derivation of the equation used to estimate N with the Petersen method?
    * What are the rules for determining which distribution is used to construct a confidence interval for N?
    * Why did Chapman modify Petersen's equation?
    * What is the equation for the Chapman Modification of the Petersen method?
    * What are the five assumptions for the Petersen (and related) methods?
    * What precautions do fisheries technicians take to attempt to have a "closed" populations?
    * What are common behaviors of fish that lead to a violation of the assumption of equal catchability?

1. Read [Section 8.3.1 in Hayes *et al.*](MarkRecap/Hayesetal-2007-Sect8-3part.pdf) (the [complete reading](http://www4.ncsu.edu/~tkwak/Hayes_et_al_2007.pdf") and consider the items below.
    * What are the six assumptions for the Petersen (and related) methods?
    * What is the equation for the Chapman Modification of the Petersen method?
    * Define N-hat, n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>, and m<sub>2</sub>.
    * What criteria are used to determine when the normal approximation can be used to develop confidence intervals for N?
    
1. Read Section 9.2 in *Introductory Fisheries Analyses with R* and consider the items below.
    * What is the equation for the Chapman Modification of the Petersen method?
    * What are the five assumptions for the Petersen (and related) methods?
    * What R function is used to compute the Petersen (or related) estimates of abundance?
    * What argument must be included to specifically use the Chapman modification of the Petersen method?
    * This function can accept "data" in two ways. What are those two ways?
    * What function is used to extract the actual population estimate from the results of the main function?
    * What function is used to extract the confidence interval for the population estimate from the results of the main function?
