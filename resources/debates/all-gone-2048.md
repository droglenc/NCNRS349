## Background

One of the greatest controversies in fisheries in the last 20 years is related to an article by [Worm et al. (2006)](Worm-et-al-2006.pdf) that was marketed in a press release with the proclamation that "all fish gone by 2048" (e.g., see these from the [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/03/science/03fish.html?_r=0), [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/02/AR2006110200913.html), and [CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/salt-water-fish-extinction-seen-by-2048/)).  This paper was quickly criticized by, among others, [Branch (2008)](Branch-2008.pdf).  In 2009, several fisheries scientists, including the lead author of the original publication, published a rebuttal paper in [Worm et al. (2009)](Worm-et-al-2009.pdf).  The rebuttal paper received much less national public attention and, thus, the results (which many claim are incorrect) from the original paper are still declared by some.  Thus, as a fisheries scientist/manager you need to be aware of the issues surrounding this controversy.
