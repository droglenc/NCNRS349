1. Read [Trebitz and Hoffman (2015)](Trebitz_Hoffman_TAFS2015.pdf) and be prepared to discuss the items below. [*Dr. Cooper's slides will [be here]() following his presentation.*]

    **Coastal Wetland Support for Great Lakes Fisheries ...**
    * What big question/idea is being addressed in the paper?
    * Why did the authors feel that the study was important?
    * Write out the specific questions/hypotheses addressed.
    * What data were used to address these hypotheses?
    * How did the authors identify coastal wetland species that support Great Lakes commercial and recreational fisheries?
    * Check out that **Evaluating wetland associationsâ€¦** section. Yeah, lots of complex stats in there! But in general, what were the goals of these difficult analyses?
    
    **Results (The Results in this paper are much easier to read than the Methods!)**
    * Which wetland species appeared to provide "direct fisheries support" in the Great Lakes? Why is it "direct support?"
    * Which wetland species provide "indirect fisheries support" in the Great Lakes?  Why is it "indirect?"
    * Which commercially important species show up in Great Lakes coastal wetlands as larvae?
    * What as the one consistent life history trait among the common coastal wetland species?
    * The ordination results (NMDS) are tough to understand. However, what pattern ("axis of variation"") did they mention? In other words, fish community structure tended to correlate with ...?
    
    **Discussion**
    * Did the authors answer their Big Questions?  In other words, were they able to identify metrics of fisheries support?
    * What about their Specific Questions?  In other words, did they identify species that provide fisheries support? How did wetland condition affect fisheries support?
    * What do the authors think of using a "poster child species" to represent coastal wetland support of fisheries? Why?
    * The authors found that ~50% of the commercial and ~80% of the recreational fishery harvest in the Great Lakes is accounted for by wetland-using species. Is this a good argument for preserving/restoring coastal wetlands? Why **and** why not?
