## Analysis & Interpretation Questions II

Construct similar length- and age-frequency histograms and PSD and PSD-P calculations for each species from the **POST-ANGLING** period.  Use this information to answer the following questions.

<ol start="5">
  <li>Assess the length- and age-frequency histograms for Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Perch, and Largemouth Bass from Mid Lake after angler exploitation was allowed.</li>
  <li>Write a clear paragraph, for each species, that compares the pre- and post-angling size- and age-structure results.</li>
  <li>How did your summaries from the previous question compare to your expectations from before seeing the post-angling results?  Suggest possible reasons for any differences.</li>
  <li>How do you suppose the annual mortality rate differed between the two periods for each species?  Use specific evidence to support your supposition.</li>
</ol>
