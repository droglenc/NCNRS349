1. Read [these notes](BKG.html) and Chapter 10 in *Introductory Fisheries Analyses with R* and consider the items below.
    * Define N<sub>0</sub>, K<sub>t-1</sub>, N<sub>t</sub>, C<sub>t</sub>, f<sub>t</sub>, q, and E<sub>t-1</sub>
    * What is the equation for the Leslie model? What type of equation is this?
    * How is q estimated from the Leslie model?
    * How is N<sub>0</sub> estimated from the Leslie model?
    * Geometrically, how is N<sub>0</sub> represented?
    * What was Ricker's suggested modification to the Leslie model?
    * What are the six assumptions of the Leslie model?
    * Which assumptions are most likely to be violated? Discuss why.
    * What is the equation for the DeLury model? What type of equation is this?
    * How is q estimated from the FeLury model?
    * How is N<sub>0</sub> estimated from the DeLury model?
    * When should the Leslie model be used in comparison to the DeLury model?
    * What R function can be used to fit the Leslie and DeLury methods in R?
    * How is the population abundance and catchability estimates extracted from the results of this function.
    * How are confidence intervals for the population abundance and catchability estimates extracted from the results of this function.
    * What R function is used to perform a K-pass removal estimate?
    * How is the population abundance and probability of capture estimates extracted from the results of this function.
    * How are confidence intervals for the population abundance and probability of capture estimates extracted from the results of this function.
1. Read [Rosenberger (2010)](Popeetal-2010-Box11-1.pdf) Box 11.1 in Pope *et al.* the complete chapter [is here](http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2010_pope_k001.pdf)) and consider the items below.
    * What is a primary assumption of the removal method?
    * Describe a common behavior of fish that leads to a violation of this assumption?
    * What does this particular assumption violation mean for the estimates of abundance and catchability from the removal method?
    * What is the author's argument for how biased results from the removal method could still be useful?
    * However, how does the stated findings from the Rosenberger and Dunham (2005) study go against the previous argument?
