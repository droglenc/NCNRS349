## Fitting Stock-Recruitment Model
[Allen and Miranda (1998)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304380098000064) examined recruitment data for [Black (*Pomoxis nigromaculatus*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_crappie) and [White Crappie (*Pomoxis annularis*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_crappie) in four reservoirs in Arkansas. Through electrofishing samples they estimated the CPE (number per hectare) of age-0 and age-1+ fish for each of several years in each reservoir. They then arranged the data such that "recruits" were the age-0 fish and "stock" were the age-1+ fish captured the previous year (as most of these crappies were mature at age-1). The data for all four reservoirs are in CrappieARMS.csv ([data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/FSAdata/master/data-raw/CrappieARMS.csv), [Meta](http://derekogle.com/fishR/data/data-html/CrappieARMS.html)). Fit the Ricker and density-independent stock-recruitment models to the data from [Nimrod Lake](https://www.swl.usace.army.mil/Missions/Recreation/Lakes/Nimrod-Lake/) and determine which model "fits better" to these data.
