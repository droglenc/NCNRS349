1. Read Sections 11.1 and 11.2 (*skip Section 11.2.2*) in *Introductory Fisheries Analyses with R* and [these notes](BKG.html) and consider the items below.
    * Define A, C<sub>t</sub>, C<sub>t+1</sub>, and Z.
    * What is the formula for computing annual mortality from catches that are separated by a single year?
    * Describe the difference between longitudinal and cross-sectional catch-at-age data.
    * What must be true for a vector of consecutive catches-at-age to be equal when extracted from longitudinal and cross-sectional data.
    * What is the equation for the "catch-curve" model (that shows how catch is related to time)? Show how this equation can be linearized.
    * How is Z estimated from catch-curve data?
    * How is A estimated from Z?
    * What is the characteristic shape of catch curve data? Specifically, identify three regions on the curve.
    * Why does the catch curve have the shape described in the previous question?
    * What are the assumptions of a catch curve model for estimating Z?
    * What R function can be used to efficiently perform a catch curve estimate of Z?
    * What R function is used to extract the estimates of Z and A from this function?
    * What R function is used to extract confidence intervals for Z and A from this function?
1. Read [Miranda and Bettolli (2006) Sections 6.1-6.3](Miranda-Bettolli-2006-Sect6-1-3.pdf) (the [complete reading](http://s3.amazonaws.com/file-storage.INDIVIDUAL-ACTIVITIES-CooperativeResearchUnits.digitalmeasures.usgs.edu/pbettoli/intellcont/chapter6-1.pdf)) and consider the items below.
    * What is "mortality"?
    * What is the characteristic shape of catch curve data? Specifically, identify three regions on the curve.
    * Why does the catch curve have the shape described in the previous question?
    * What are the assumptions of a catch curve model for estimating Z?
    * What assumption about recruitment is made for a catch curve? Is this a realistic assumption? How do modest violations of this assumption affect the estimates of Z?
    * How large of a sample is needed for a catch curve analysis?
    * What is a weighted catch-curve analysis?
