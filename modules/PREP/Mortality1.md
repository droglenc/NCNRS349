1. Define A, C<sub>t</sub>, C<sub>t+1</sub>, and Z.
1. What is the formula for computing annual mortality from catches that are separated by a single year?
1. Describe the difference between longitudinal and cross-sectional catch-at-age data.
1. What must be true for a vector of consecutive catches-at-age to be equal when extracted from longitudinal and cross-sectional data.
1. What is the equation for the "catch-curve" model (that shows how catch is related to time)? Show how this equation can be linearized.
1. How is Z estimated from catch-curve data?
1. How is A estimated from Z?
1. What is the characteristic shape of catch curve data? Specifically, identify three regions on the curve.
1. Why does the catch curve have the shape described in the previous question?
1. What R function can be used to efficiently perform a catch curve estimate of Z?
1. What R function is used to extract the estimates of Z and A from this function?
1. What R function is used to extract confidence intervals for Z and A from this function?
1. What is "mortality"?
1. What assumption about recruitment is made for a catch curve? Is this a realistic assumption? How do modest violations of this assumption affect the estimates of Z?
1. How large of a sample is needed for a catch curve analysis?
1. What is a weighted catch-curve analysis?

1. What are the assumptions of a catch curve model for estimating Z?
