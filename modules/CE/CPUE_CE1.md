## Calculate CPUE
Calculate CPUE for the situations below. Choose a scale of effort that "makes sense" (and is neither too small nor too big). Show your work.

1. Suppose that 67 Channel Catfish (*Ictalurus punctatus*) were caught in seven hoop nets set for only one night (each).
1. Suppose that 337 Cisco (*Coregonus artedi*) were caught in 650 m of gillnet set for two nights.
1. Suppose that 146 age-1 Yellow Perch (*Perca flavescens*) were caught in three trawl tows that lasted 7, 6, and 6 minutes, respectively.

1. Describe the conceptual relationship between CPUE and N? Define all symbols if you show the equation.
