## Meta-Analytical Estimates of M
As noted in the readings M can be estimated from other population dynamics parameters (some of which we have not yet learned). This [online tool](https://connect.fisheries.noaa.gov/natural-mortality-tool/) provides meta-analytic estimates of M based on a wide variety of relationships and estimated of population dynamics parameters supplied by the user. The tool will also combined the individual estimates into an overall composite estimate.

Use this tool to generate meta-analytic estimates of M for the following situations. For each situation, report how many estimates of M were obtained and the mean and median composite estimate of M. For each situation make sure to include the (*correctly spelled*) species' scientific name in the appropriate box of the tool.

1. A population of Northern Pike with a VBGF Linf of 93.3 cm, VBGF K of 0.310, VBGF t0 of -0.1, and maximum age of 15. 
1. A population of Arctic Charr with a maximum age of 30, an age at maturity of 8, VBGF Linf of 62 cm, VBGF K of 0.055, and VBGF t0 of -2.5.
1. A population of Black Crappie with an age at maturity of 3 and a VBGF K of 0.4.

## Estimates of A
Use the **mean** composite estimate of M from above with the following assumptions to estimate A for each population.

{:start="4"}
1. Assume that the population of Northern Pike is unexploited.
1. Assume that the population of Arctic Charr are exposed to an artisinal subsistence fishery with F=0.1.
1. Assume that the population of Black Crappie is a population recreational fishery with F=0.6.
