## Hypothetical Class Data
The hypothetical "Real Data" discussed in class lecture showed catches for age-0 to age-5 fish of 77, 111, 126, 104, 81, and 64. Enter these data into a data frame and compute the instantaneous and annual mortality rates.

## Snapper Mortality
[Australian Snapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasian_snapper) (*Chrysophrys auratus*; sometimes referred to as Silver Seabream) were captured from [Hauraki Gulf (Auckland, New Zealand)](https://www.newzealand.com/us/feature/hauraki-gulf-and-islands/) in research trawl surveys at two separate locations (KAH8810 and KAH0012). Length was measured to the neared cm for all captured fish and fish were *haphazardly* sampled for annual ages estimated from thin-sectioned otoliths. The researchers hoped to assess the mortality rate for the stocks of Snapper at both locations. Data from all fish at both locations is in SnapperHG1.csv ([Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/FSAdata/master/data-raw/SnapperHG1.csv), [Meta](http://derekogle.com/fishR/data/data-html/SnapperHG1.html)). You should compute the mortality rate for Snapper captured at **KAH8810**.
