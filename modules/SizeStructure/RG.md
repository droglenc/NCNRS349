1. Read Chapter 6 in *Introductory Fisheries Analyses with R* and [these notes](BKG.html) and consider the items below.
    * Why is an analysis of size structure important in fisheries management?
    * What does a "length frequency" show?
    * What R function is used to convert measured lengths to length categories or bins? What arguments does this function require?
    * What R function is used to make a length frequency table from a length category variable? What arguments does this function require?
    * What R function is used to make a length frequency histogram? What arguments does this function require?
    * What kind of "function" is used to visually compare length frequencies between two groups?
    * What is a proportional size distribution (PSD) indice?
    * What are the five Gabelhouse length categories?
    * What R function can be used to find the values for the Gabelhouse length categories for a particular species of fish? What arguments does this function require?
    * Explain what an "incremental" PSD indice is?
    * Explain what a "traditional" PSD indice is?
    * What R function can be used to easily compute PSD indices and associated confidence intervals? What arguments does this function require?
    * What statistical test is used to compare the distribution of lengths between groups of fish? What R function is used to perform this test?
    * What statistical test is used to compare the frequency of individuals in Gabelhouse length categories between groups of fish? What R function is used to perform this test?
1. Read [Anderson's "Catch & Release or Selective Harvest"](catch_release_Anderson.pdf) and consider the items below.
    * What is a PSD? How is it calculated?
    * What characteristics might describe a population (of, say, Bluegill) that has a PSD of less than 10?
    * What is a PSD for a Bluegill population that "in balance."
    * What is selective harvest? Why might a fish manager develop a regulation to promote selective harvest?
