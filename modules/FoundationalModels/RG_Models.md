1. Read [this](http://alexei.nfshost.com/PopEcol/lec5/explog.html) and [this](https://www.boundless.com/biology/textbooks/boundless-biology-textbook/population-and-community-ecology-45/environmental-limits-to-population-growth-251/exponential-population-growth-929-12185/)[^1] and consider the following items.
    * Draw a plot of abundance (numbers of organisms) against time that represents exponential growth.
    * Draw a plot of abundance (numbers of organisms) against time that represents logistic growth.
    * What do $N_{t}$, $N_{t+1}$, $N_{0}$, $r$ and $K$ represent in the exponential and logistic growth functions/models.
    * What are the fundamental differences in assumptions underlying the exponentnial and logistic growth functions/models.
    * What is the difference between a discrete and a continuous function/model?
    * Describe a (fish-related) situation where the exponential function/model may adequately represent population growth?
    * Describe a (fish-related) situation where the exponential function/model may adequately represent population growth?
