[Krueger and Decker (2010)](KruegerDecker_2010_Process.pdf) outlined the fisheries management process.  You will be assigned to read one (or part of one) of the following recent fisheries management plans.

* [Leech Lake Management Plan, 2011-15](http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/recreation/fishing/largelakes/leech/leechlakemp.pdf).
* [Fisheries Management Plan for the Minnesota Waters of Lake Superior (2006)](http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/publications/fisheries/special_reports/163.pdf).
    * Focus on Lake Trout
    * Focus on Rainbow Trout
* [Lake Michigan Integrated Fisheries Management Plan, 2003-2013](http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/fishing/Documents/LakeMichigan/LMIFMP2003-2013.pdf).
    * Focus on Goal I
    * Focus on Goal II
    * Focus on Goal III

These plans may use slightly different terminology than what was introduced by Krueger and Decker (2010).  Thus, you should, in two pages or less, ...

1. Show how the terminology used in your management plan is related to that used by Krueger and Decker (2010).  [In other words, specifically show how the words in the management plan equate to the words used by Krueger and Decker (2010).]
1. Demonstrate the goals, objectives, problem identification, actions, evaluation, and information base of Krueger and Decker (2010) with one full example from your management plan. [In other words, think about what you could extract from your management plan that you could use to demonstrate the concepts of Krueger and Decker (2010).]
1. Provide a critique of your management plan in terms of what Krueger and Decker (2010) suggest for how goals, objectives, problems, actions, and evaluations should be defined. [In other words, do you think that the management plan adequately follows the concepts laid out by Krueger and Decker (2010)?]   Defend your critique.
