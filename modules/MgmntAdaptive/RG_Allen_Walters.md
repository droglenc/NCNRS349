1. Read Section 2.7 in [The Process of Fisheries Management (Krueger and Decker, 2010)](../MgmntProcess/KruegerDecker_2010_Process.pdf).

1. Read[^1] [Adaptive Management for a Turbulent Future (Allen *et al.*, 2011)](Allenetal_2011_AdaptiveManagement.pdf) and consider the following items.
    * Describe (in your own words) what "adaptive management" is.
    * What is a key focus of adaptive management?
        * What are four sources of this (what the key focus is)?
    * What are the five challenges to implementing adaptive management?
        * How do laws affect our ability to implement adaptive management?
    * Describe (in your own words) what "structured decision making" is.
    * Explain Figure 3.
        * Why is adapative management only useful when there is both high uncertainty and high controllability?
        * Why is adaptive management not useful when either uncertainty or controllability are low?

1. Read [Is Adaptive Management Helping to Solve Fisheries Problems? (Walters, 2007)](Walters_2007_AdaptiveManagement.pdf) and consider the following items.
    * What are the main reasons for difficulties in the implementation of adaptive management?
        * Which, according to the author, reason has been most important in leading to non-implementation of adaptive management?
    * Describe the author's Red Snapper (*Lutjanus campechanus*) example.
        * What was the main point that he was trying to make with this example?
    * What did the author mean by the statement "[t]here remains the fundamental problem of how to convince decision makers to support management experiments. I believe that the key to this problem is for the scientific community to agree to stop providing simplistic point estimates and management advice"?  How does this relate to what you have been asked to do a number of times throughout the first part of this course?
