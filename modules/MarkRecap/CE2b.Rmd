## Understanding Assumption Violations in Mark-Recapture Analyses
<img src="http://derekogle.com/NCNRS349/img/computer-1.jpg" alt="Simulations" class="img-right">
The analytical methodology for the Petersen family of mark-recapture methods for estimating population abundance is based on the following five assumptions:

* The population is physically (i.e., no immigration or emigration) and demographically (i.e., no recruitment or mortality) closed (so that $N$ is constant over the time of sampling).
* Marked individuals returned to the population mix randomly with unmarked individuals.
* All individuals within a sample have an equal probability of capture.
* Marks are neither lost no missed.
* Individual behavior or vulnerability does not change after being marked.

Violations of these assumptions may result in biased estimates of population abundance.  The degree and direction of these biases vary depending on the type and degree of violation.  An understanding of these biases is needed to actively guard against them and to inform careful interpretations of results.  The effects of assumption violations on the estimates of abundance are the focus of this exercise.

#### Stating Your Expectations

The formula for the Petersen estimate of population abundance is

$$ \hat{N} = \frac{Mn}{m} $$

where $\widehat{N}$ is the estimated size of the population just prior to the first sample, $M$ is the number of fish from the first sample that were marked and returned to the population, $n$ is the number of fish in the second sample, and $m$ is the number of marked fish in the second sample.  This formula can be rewrriten as

$$ \hat{N} = \frac{M}{\frac{m}{n}} $$

where $\frac{m}{n}$ is the proportion of fish in the second sample that were previously marked.

The reason for rewriting this formula in this way is that it can be seen that if $\frac{m}{n}$ is larger than it should be, then $\hat{N}$ will be lower than it should be; i.e., $N$ is underestimated.  Thus, if more marked fish appear in the second sample than expected, then $\frac{m}{n}$ will be too large and $N$ will be underestimated.  Of course, the opposite is also true -- if fewer marked fish appear in the second sample than expected, then $\frac{m}{n}$ will be too small and $N$ will be overestimated

So, assessing the effect of assumption violations on the estimate of $N$ reduces to determining if the violation would result in more or fewer marked fish in the second sample than would be expected.

#### Questions III -- Expectations from Violated Assumptions

For each situation below, identify whether you think that the population abundance will be over, under, or accurately estimated by the Chapman modification method.  Provide a reasoning for each of your answers.

1. Marked individuals lose their mark (or tag) before the second sample.
1. Marked and unmarked individuals suffer mortality (at the same rate) before the second sample.
1. Marked, but not unmarked, individuals suffer mortality before the second sample.
1. Unmarked, but not marked, individuals suffer mortality before the second sample.
1. Individuals recruit (or migrate) into the population between the first and second samples.
1. Marked individuals show a higher catchability in the second sample (i.e., "trap happy") compared to unmarked individuals.
1. Marked individuals show a lower catchability in the second sample (i.e., "trap shy") compared to unmarked individuals.
1. Technicians do not notice some marked fish in the second sample.
1. Marked fish are released next to the nets used to take the second sample.
