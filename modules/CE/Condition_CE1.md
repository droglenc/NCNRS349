## Inch Lake Bluegill
[Inch Lake](http://dnr.wi.gov/lakes/lakepages/LakeDetail.aspx?wbic=2764300&page=facts) is a 12.5 ha inland lake in northern Wisconsin that has been managed as catch-and-release for all species since 2006. Researchers at Northland College have monitored fish populations in Inch Lake since 2007. The total lengths (**inches**) and weights (**g**) for subsamples of several species of fish collected from Inch Lake in May of 2007 and 2008 are recorded in InchLake2.csv ([Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/FSAdata/master/data-raw/InchLake2.csv) / [meta](http://derekogle.com/fishR/data/data-html/InchLake2.html)).

1. For Bluegills captured only in 2007, determine if the mean relative weight differed among Gabelhouse length categories. Provide a plot, with confidence intervals, that depicts your results.
1. Repeat the previous question for Bluegills captured only in 2008.
1. Make at least three observations (of differences or similarities) from empirically comparing your results between years
1. Make at least two plausible ecological explanations for what you observed (in the previous question).
