1. Define all symbols including:
    a. N<sub>0</sub>, q, Z, F, M, A, S, u, v, m, n, C<sub>t</sub>, f<sub>t</sub>, N<sub>t</sub>, r
    a. M,n,m from mark-recapture
1. Identify different types of fishing regulations (e.g., minimum size, hartvest slot, bag limit, gear restrictions, etc.)
1. Describe a conceptual model of a stock (i.e., what things effect stock abundance and biomass)
1. Write discrete and continuous population growth models and define terms.
1. Density-dependence – define, example graphs, example explanations (e.g., depletion of resources lead to increase mortality, decrease in fecundity, etc.)
1. Types of dynamics with different values of r in a discrete popn growth model.
1. What is the catch equation, define all aspects

1. Define CPE, why would we use it
1. Thoroughly discuss hyperstability and hyperdepletion?
1. What does Maunder argue are flaws with CPUE data.  Provide specific examples.
1. Describe how the Leslie methods can be used to estimate population sizes.
1. Calculate q and N<sub>0</sub> from Leslie model regression results.
1. Understand the geometrical representation of N<sub>0</sub> on a Leslie model plot.
1. What happens to q or N<sub>0</sub> estimates if mortality/recruitment exist.
1. What happens to Leslie model shape if catchability increases/decreases?
1. Four main assumptions of Leslie model and how do we try to make sure they are met.
1. Explain which assumption of depletion/removal methods is most commonly violated.  Why?

1. Why use Chapman vs. Petersen?
1. Understand capture histories; derive M, m, and n from capture history summaries.
1. Perform a Chapman M/R calculation from raw values.
1. Assumptions, and what violations do to population estimates.
1. Identify types and key features of scales and otoliths.
1. Explain the advantages and disadvantages of the various structures used to assign age to fish.

1. Interpret Z and A
1. Compute A from Z, Z from A
1. Look at two plots and identify the one with the higher mortality rate
1. Assumptions? How does shape of catch-curve change if assumptions are violated?
1. Describe the “limbs” of a catch curve and explain why they appear the way they do.
