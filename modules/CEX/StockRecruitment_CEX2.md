## Fitting Stock-Recruitment Model
Allen and Miranda (1998) examined recruitment data for Black (*Pomoxis nigromaculatus*) and White Crappie (*Pomoxis annularis*) in four reservoirs in Arkansas. Through electrofishing samples the estimated the CPE (number per hectare) of age-0 and age-1+ fish for each of several years in each reservoir. They then arranged the data such that "recruits" were the age-0 fish and "stock" was the age-1+ fish captured the previous year (as most of these crappies were mature at age-1). The data for all four reservoirs are in CrappieARMS.csv ([data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/FSAdata/master/data-raw/CrappieARMS.csv), [Meta](http://derekogle.com/fishR/data/data-html/CrappieARMS.html)). Fit the Ricker and density-independent stock-recruitment models to the data from Nimrod Reservoir and determine which model "fits better" to these data.
