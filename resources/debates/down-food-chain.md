title: Fisheries Myth Assignment II
subtitle: "Fishing Down The Food Chain"
---

## Background

[Pauly *et al.* (1998)](Pauly-et-al-1998.pdf) found that fishing was reducing the mean trophic level of the global catch.  Their findings suggested that humans had fished out the large, valuable, high trophic level fish (e.g., tuna) and were moving down the food chain to small, less valuable, lower trophic level fish (e.g., oysters).  A decade later, [Branch *et al.* (2010)](Branch-et-al-2010.pdf) updated the data set and refuted the original findings.  Of course, the original authors suggested several problems with the new article and a great debated ensued (see [Cressy (2010)](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101117/full/news.2010.619.html)).  This debate continues to this with [proponents having their website](http://www.fishingdown.org/) and [opponents having theirs](http://cfooduw.org/myths/we-are-fishing-down-the-food-chain/).  As a fisheries scientist/manager you should be informed about this debate.
