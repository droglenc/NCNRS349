* Species names (I have 43 mentions on my list)
* Define all symbols including
    * N<sub>o</sub>, q, Z, F, M, A, S, u, v, m, n, C<sub>t</sub>, f<sub>t</sub>, N<sub>t</sub>, r, K<sub>t-1</sub>
    * M,n,m and M<sub>i</sub>, n<sub>i</sub>, m<sub>i</sub> from mark-recapture
* Describe a conceptual model of a stock (i.e., what things effect stock abundance and biomass)
* Four Fs

* Write discrete and continuous population growth models and define terms.
* Rates that effect population abundance, biomass?
* Density-dependence – define, example graphs, example explanations (e.g., depletion of resources lead to increase mortality, decrease in fecundity, etc.)
* Types of dynamics with different values of r in a discrete popn growth model.

* What is the catch equation, define all aspects
* Define q, q*f<sub>t</sub>, q*N<sub>t</sub>, q*f<sub>t</sub>*N<sub>t</sub>
* Define CPE, why would we use it
* What is the conceptual relationship between CPE and N?
* Thoroughly discuss hyperstability and hyperdepletion?
* What does Maunder argue are flaws with CPUE data. Provide specific examples.

* Why use Chapman vs. Petersen vs. Schnabel?
* Perform a Chapman M/R calculation from raw values.
* What are the mark-recapture assumptions, and what do violations do to population estimates
* Understand capture histories

* Describe how the Leslie method can be used to estimate population sizes.
* Compute estimates of N<sub>0</sub>o and q from Leslie model regression results.
* Four main assumptions of Leslie model and how do we try to make sure they are met.
* What happens to q or N<sub>0</sub> estimates from a Leslie model if mortality/recruitment exists.
* What happens to Leslie model shape if catchability increases/decreases?
* Explain which assumption of depletion/removal methods is most commonly violated.  Why?
* Summarize Rosenberger’s (2010) argument.
* Interpret results from `depletion()` *et al.*

* Describe two ways in which fish are selected for the "age sample" and which one is most common and why?
* Compute an age-length key from a two-way table.
*	Identify proportions and number of fish that will be assigned a certain age from an age-length key according to the Isermann-Knight method.
*	Describe how an age-length-key is used in the Isermann-Knight method.
*	Describe why age-length-keys are used.

*	Describe difference between cross-sectional and longitudinal catch curves
*	Identify vectors of catch and ages from a matrix of catches-at-age for cross-sectional and longitudinal catch curves.
*	Assumptions? How does shape of catch-curve change if assumptions are violated?
*	Describe the “limbs” of a catch curve and explain why they appear the way they do.
*	Interpret Z and A
*	Compute A from Z, Z from A, S from A
*	Look at two plots and identify the one with the higher mortality rate

*	Describe ways in which F and M can be estimated.
*	Compute the exploitation rate from mark-recapture results

* What is recruitment overfishing?
* Define the SPR equation?
* How is the SPR used in a management situation?

*	What is recruitment?  How is it defined?  What are some examples?
*	Define density-independence and density-dependence as it relates to stock-recruit relationships.  Draw the relationship of S/R vs S and R vs S.
*	Completely compare and contrast the Beverton-Holt and Ricker stock-recruit models.  Define the parameters, identify the shapes, recognize parameters in the equations, identify effects of reduced number of stock on number of recruits.
*	Compute R<sub>p</sub> and S<sub>p</sub> (if appropriate) from estimates of a and b, identify the effect of increases/decreased a,b values on R<sub>p</sub> and S<sub>p</sub>.
*	Describe the biological mechanisms that lead to the dome shape in the Ricker model.
*	Show the concept of MSY on a Ricker model (assuming a perfect semelparous species).
* What were Hansen et al. attempting to accomplish?

*	Describe aspects of the management environment within the context of a fishery that is of interest to you (e.g., Apostle Islands Lake Trout, Mille Lacs Walleye, Georges Bank Cod, Atlantic Ocean Bluefin Tuna, Lake Winnebago Sturgeon, Leech Lake Burbot, Bristol Bay Sockeye Salmon). You may have to research this fishery so that you can adequately describe several items in each aspect of the management environment.
*	Describe (beyond drawing the circle) the management process.

* Describe the Lake Superior Management Plan Advisory Panel and how it is being used to construct a Lake Superior Management Plan.

* What is meant by wetlands fish species that provide "direct" or "indirect" fisheries relevance?
* What "big question" was addressed in the Trebitz and Hoffman (2015) paper and was their "big question" addressed? Explain.
* What are some "benefits" of coastal wetlands? Explain.
* What is an index of biotic integrity? Why are fish species included in the IBI for Great Lakes coastal wetlands?
