Read [Sections 7.1-7.4 in Ogle (2016)](RESOURCES/Ogle_WeightLength.pdf) and answer the following questions.

1. What are five things that weight-length relationships are used for?
1. Which are more precise -- length or weight measurements? Explain.
1. What is the difference between a common and natural logarithm?
1. Why is linear regression inappropriate to model weight-length data?
1. Weight-length data follows what kind of function for most fish species?
1. Demonstrate how this function is transformed to a linear function?
1. What parameter does the slope of the transformed model represent?
1. What R function is used to fit a linear regression?
1. What R function is used to extract the regression parameter estimates?
1. What R function is used to extract the regression parameter confidence intervals?
1. What R function is used to determine if there is a significant relationship between weight and length (or their transformed values)?
1. How does one check whether the assumptions of a linear regression have been met or not?
1. What does it mean about fish shape over time if the slope parameter is equal to 3? If it is not equal to 3?
