* Scientific names (I have 43 on my list).
* Be prepared to match a general fisheries science topic (e.g., "growth", "recruitment", etc.) to a specific metric (e.g., "von Bertalanffy model", "PSD", etc.).
*	What are common misinterpretations of L<sub>&infin;</sub>, K, and t<sub>0</sub>?
*	What does a larger/smaller K mean in a von Bertalanffy model?  Larger/smaller L<sub>&infin;</sub>?
*	What is “omega” in the Galucci and Quinn version of the von B? Show how to calculate it from the results of a traditional von B and explain what it means.
*	Predicted mean lengths from a von B equation given an age.
*	Predict the amount of time it takes for the mean length to increase from any value to half way to L<sub>&infin;</sub>.
*	Explain what forces serve to shape a length frequency.
*	Discuss how you would statistically test if two length frequencies are similar or not.
*	Construct a cumulative frequency distribution from a length frequency distribution.
*	Define stock and quality lengths.
*	Define PSD and PSD-X (or RSD-X) and compute from a length frequency or reverse cumulative length frequency table.
*	Draw rough length frequency histogram from a given PSD, PSD-X value.  Describe what a population looks like based on the PSD, PSD-X values.
*	Provide possible interpretations from a Tic-Tac-Toe graph that uses PSD, PSD-X values.
*	Hypothesize about the structure of a fish community and what forces are important in shaping that community from a length frequency histogram.
*	What was Anderson’s argument relative to “selective harvest”?
*	Explain what allometric and isometric “growth” is and how one would test for it.
*	Show how to linearize the weight-length power function relationship.
*	Compute/find a and b (on the original scale) from the log(L)-log(W) regression results.
* Predict weight given a length and a log(W)-log(L) relationship results.
*	Define Ws and Wr.  From what is Ws derived?
*	Compute Wr given a Ws equation and the length and weight of a fish.
*	Be able to explain and interpret Wr.  Describe ecological or physiological characteristics of the population based on Wr values.
* Using creel survey results, calculate the percentage of fish "saved" if a bag limit is reduced.
*	Describe what the populations of Bluegill, Yellow Perch, and Largemouth Bass are likely to “look like” (in terms of size, condition, abundance, and mortality) in a lake that (i) has been closed to angling and that same lake within one year after having been opened up to angling or (ii) was recently invaded by Northern Pike.
* Identify what characteristics and reasonings would lead a manager to use (i) bag limits, (ii) minimum length limits, (iii) protected slot length limits, (iv) harvest slot length limits, and (v) maximum length limits. What might the goals or objectives of these regulations be?
