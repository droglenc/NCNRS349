**From Ogle (2016)**

1. What is a proportional size distribution (PSD) indice?
1. What are the five Gabelhouse length categories?
1. What R function can be used to find the values for the Gabelhouse length categories for a particular species of fish? What arguments does this function require?
1. Explain what an "incremental" PSD indice is?
1. Explain what a "traditional" PSD indice is?
1. What R function can be used to easily compute PSD indices and associated confidence intervals? What arguments does this function require?
1. What statistical test is used to compare the distribution of lengths between groups of fish? What R function is used to perform this test?
1. What statistical test is used to compare the frequency of individuals in Gabelhouse length categories between groups of fish? What R function is used to perform this test?

**From Anderson's "Catch & Release or Selective Harvest"**
1. What is a PSD? How is it calculated?
1. What characteristics might describe a population (of, say, Bluegill) that has a PSD of less than 10?
1. What is a PSD for a Bluegill population that "in balance."
1. What is selective harvest? Why might a fish manager develop a regulation to promote selective harvest?
