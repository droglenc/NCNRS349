1. Read [Miranda and Bettolli (2006) Section 6.6](Miranda-Bettolli-2006-Sect6-6.pdf) (the [complete chapter](http://s3.amazonaws.com/file-storage.INDIVIDUAL-ACTIVITIES-CooperativeResearchUnits.digitalmeasures.usgs.edu/pbettoli/intellcont/chapter6-1.pdf)) and consider the following items.
    * Define Z, F, M, and &mu;.
    * What is the relationship between Z, F, and M?
    * Explain how the regression between Z and fishing effort can be used to estimate M. What are some problems with this method.
    * Explain how the catch-curve methods of the last module could be used to estimate M.
    * Explain how mark-recapture data can be used to estimate F (carefully explain what else must be know for this method to work).
    * Explain what is meant by "meta-analysis to estimate M, F, or Z."
1. Read Section 11.4 in *Introductory Fisheries Analyses with R* and consider the items below.
    * Define Z, F, M, and &mu;.
    * What is the relationship between Z, F, and M?
    * Explain what is meant by "meta-analysis to estimate M, F, or Z."
    * What are the five methods to estimate M or F according to Mirand and Bettoli?
    * Explain the meta-analytic method for estimating M proposed by Then *et al.* (2015).
    * What R function is used to compute the meta-analytic estimates of M? What argument is used to compute the estimate of M proposed by Then *et al.* (2015)?
    * Check out [this online tool](http://server.adrianhordyk.com/shiny/Natural-Mortality-Tool/) that provides meta-analytic estimates of M.
1. Read [Miranda and Bettolli (2006) Sections 6.8-6.10](Miranda-Bettolli-2006-Sect6-8-10.pdf) (the [complete chapter](http://s3.amazonaws.com/file-storage.INDIVIDUAL-ACTIVITIES-CooperativeResearchUnits.digitalmeasures.usgs.edu/pbettoli/intellcont/chapter6-1.pdf)) and consider the following items.
    * Define Z, F, M, and &mu;.
    * How is "additive mortality" defined?
    * How is "compensatory mortality" defined?
    * What does "additive mortality" look like in a plot of A versus &mu;?
    * What does "compensatory" look like in a plot of A versus &mu;?
    * How might the realization that compensatory mortality exists and an understand of how it exists influence management decisions?
    * Define "accuracy" and "precision."
    * What are suggested sample sizes for catch curve analyses?
    * While it is not clear in the reading, what is your best guess from the context of the reading what F<sup>0.1</sup> is?
    * What are management tools (i.e., regulations) commonly used to modify fishing mortality?
    * What is the greatest difficulty in estimating mortality?
1. Read [Allen and Hightower (2010) Mortality](Allen-Hightower-2010-Mortality.pdf) (most of the [complete chapter](http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/fish510/PDF/Allen%20and%20Hightower%201.pdf)) and consider the following items.
