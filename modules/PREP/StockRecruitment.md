Read [Section 13.1 in Ogle (2016)](RESOURCES/Ogle_Recruitment.pdf) and answer the following questions.

1. What are two characteristics of most stock-recruitment (SR) data sets?
1. What are the two primary stock-recruitment (SR) functions (i.e., both are named after prominent fisheries scientists)?
1. In both SR functions, what does &alpha; and &beta; represent?
1. What is the equation for the Beverton-Holt SR function? Describe the shape of this curve? What stock/spawner abundance results in the highest level of recruitment according to this model?
1. What is the equation for the Ricker SR function? Describe the shape of this curve? What stock/spawner abundance results in the highest level of recruitment according to this model?
1. What R function is used to find starting values for fitting a SR function? What arguments does it need?
1. What R function is used for fitting a nonlinear regression? What arguments does it need for fitting a SR model?
1. What function extracts the parameters estimates from the results above?
1. What function extracts confidence intervals for the parameters from the results above?
1. How can one determine if the density-dependent parameter in a SR function is statistically significant?

Read [Maceina and Pereira (2007) Sections 4.1-4.4](RESOURCES/Maceina-Pereira-2007_41_44.pdf) (complete chapter [is here](RESOURCES/Maceina-Pereira-2007.pdf)) and answer the following questions

{:start="11"}
1. What is the distribution of recruitment rates in many marine systems? Describe what this distribution looks like and what it means for recruitment rates?
1. What (generically) is a primary cause of recruitment variability?
1. What is recruitment overfishing?
1. How (generally) is recruitment defined for a particular stock? Who decides on this definition?
1. How long does it take to collect useful stock and recruitment data?
1. What is CV?
1. What are the two primary stock-recruitment (SR) functions (i.e., both are named after prominent fisheries scientists)?
1. In both SR functions, what does &alpha; and &beta; represent?
1. What is overcompensation? What are example behaviors or population dynamics that may lead to overcompensation?
1. What type of statistical technique is used to fit a SR function to data? What type of "error structure" should be used with this technique?
