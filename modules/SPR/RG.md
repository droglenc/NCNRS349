    * Define recruitment overfishing.
    * Define spawning potential ratio (SPR).
    * Define (specifically) P.
    * What is the equation for P? Define each term in this equation.
    * Define the equation for SPR.
    * What kind of values can SPR take.
    * What are values of SPR that some authors have considered to represent recruitment overfishing for particular species?
    * How is SPR used in a management scenario (i.e., what management tools/regulations might be used to help reach a target SPR value)?
