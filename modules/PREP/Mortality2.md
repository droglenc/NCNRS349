1. Define Z, F, M, and &mu;.
1. What is the relationship between Z, F, and M?
1. Explain what is meant by "meta-analysis to estimate M, F, or Z."
1. Check out [this online tool](https://connect.fisheries.noaa.gov/natural-mortality-tool/) that provides meta-analytic estimates of M.
<br><br>
1. Explain how the regression between Z and fishing effort can be used to estimate M. What are some problems with this method.
1. Explain how the catch-curve methods of the last module could be used to estimate M.
1. Explain how mark-recapture data can be used to estimate F (carefully explain what else must be know for this method to work).
<br><br>
1. Explain how mortality rate changes with age from hatch through late adulthood.
1. What kind of management actions can be enacted to control F?
1. Describe what abundance (y-axis) versus time (x-axis) would look like if one followed a cohort (i.e., year-class) of fish through time.
1. Describe the difference between a discrete (Type I) and continuous (Type II) fishery.
1. How is &mu; calculated in a continuous fishery?
1. How is A computed from m and n in a continuous fishery? Why is the product of m and n included in this computation?
<br><br>
1. How is "additive mortality" defined?
1. How is "compensatory mortality" defined?
1. What does "additive mortality" look like in a plot of A versus &mu;?
1. What does "compensatory" look like in a plot of A versus &mu;?
1. How might the realization that compensatory mortality exists and an understand of how it exists influence management decisions?
1. What are management tools (i.e., regulations) commonly used to modify fishing mortality?
1. What is the greatest difficulty in estimating mortality?
