<p>The number of individuals in a population at some initial time, called <em>initial population size</em>, can be estimated by the sum of sequential catches required to remove all fish from the population. However, the removal of all fish from a population is costly, in monetary, human, and natural resource terms. Fortunately, estimates of the initial population size can be made by examining how the removals of fish, either through the catch of a fishery or by experimental monitoring, affect the relative abundance of fish remaining in the population <span class="citation">(Hilborn and Walters 2001)</span>. These methods are generally called depletion or removal methods as they rely on observing populations where the stock of fish is being depleted by removals of fish. In this vignette, three depletion methods (<a href="#leslie-method">Leslie</a>, <a href="#delury-method">DeLury</a>, <a href="#k-pass-methods">k-Pass</a>) used for estimating the population size are developed for a <strong>closed population</strong> with no mortality, recruitment, immigration, or emigration.</p>

<h1>Leslie Method</h1>
<p>The initial number of fish in a population is denoted by <span class="math">\(N_{0}\)</span>. The number of fish remaining in the closed population at the start of the <span class="math">\(t\)</span>th removal is the initial population size minus the cumulative catch prior to the <span class="math">\(t\)</span>th removal, <span class="math">\(K_{t-1}\)</span>. Thus,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ N_{t} = N_{0} - K_{t-1} \quad \quad \text{(1)} \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(K_{t-1}\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ K_{t-1} = C_{1} + C_{2} + \ldots + C_{t-1} = \sum_{i=1}^{t-1} C_{i}, \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\(C_{i}\)</span> is the catch for the <span class="math">\(i\)</span>th removal, and <span class="math">\(t&gt;1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(K_{0}=0\)</span>. In addition, assume that catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE or CPE) in the <span class="math">\(t\)</span>th removal event, <span class="math">\(\frac{C_{t}}{f_{t}}\)</span>, is proportional to the extant population at the time of the <span class="math">\(t\)</span>th removal event, <span class="math">\(N_{t}\)</span>, i.e.,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \frac{C_{t}}{f_{t}} = qN_{t} \quad \quad \text{(2)} \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(f_{t}\)</span> is the level of effort for the <span class="math">\(t\)</span>th removal and <span class="math">\(q\)</span> is a proportionality constant typically defined as the <em>catchability coefficient</em>. The catchability coefficent represents the fraction of the population that is removed by one unit of fishing effort. The Leslie method model is derived by substituting Equation 1 into Equation 2 for <span class="math">\(N_{t}\)</span> and simplifying,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \frac{C_{t}}{f_{t}} = q(N_{0} - K_{t-1}) \quad \quad \text{    } \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \frac{C_{t}}{f_{t}} = qN_{0} - qK_{t-1} \quad \quad \text{(3)} \]</span></p>
<p>The last expression of Equation 3 is in the form of a linear model (Figure 1) where <span class="math">\(\frac{C_{t}}{f_{t}}\)</span> is the response variable, <span class="math">\(K_{t-1}\)</span> is the explanatory variable, <span class="math">\(q\)</span> is a constant (i.e., the slope), and <span class="math">\(qN_{0}\)</span> is a constant (i.e., the intercept) because it is the product of two constants. Thus, the <em>negative of the slope</em> of this model is an estimate of the catchability coefficient, <span class="math">\(\hat{q}\)</span>. The estimated initial population size, <span class="math">\(\hat{N_{0}}\)</span>, is found by dividing the estimated intercept by <span class="math">\(\hat{q}\)</span>. Visually, <span class="math">\(\hat{N_{0}}\)</span> is the intercept of the regression line with the <em>x-axis</em>, or in words, the total cumulative catch such that the CPE is equal to zero (Figure 1).</p>

<p>Figure 1: Idealized plot of the decline in the index of abundance with increasing cumulative catch. Visual representations of the catchability coefficient, <span class="math">\(q\)</span>, and initial population size, <span class="math">\(N_{0}\)</span> are shown.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="citation">Hilborn and Walters (2001)</span> noted that the index of abundance for the Leslie method can be either catch or CPE. Furthermore, they note that the data used as an index of abundance in the Leslie method can be independent of the data used to measure cumulative catch. Thus, for example, the index of abundance could be derived from acoustic surveys whereas the cumulative catch could be recorded from fishing trapnets.</p>
<p>Confidence intervals for <span class="math">\(q\)</span> and <span class="math">\(N_{0}\)</span> can be derived from the regression results. The confidence interval for <span class="math">\(q\)</span> is a straightforward calculation of the confidence interval for the slope. However, the confidence interval for <span class="math">\(N_{0}\)</span> is not straightforward as it is estimated by the ratio of two random variables. However, <span class="citation">Krebs (1999 p. 82)</span> provides a formula for computing the standard error of <span class="math">\(\hat{N_{0}}\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ SE(\hat{N_{0}}) = \frac{s_{y|x}}{\hat{q}}\sqrt{\left[\frac{1}{n}+\frac{(\hat{N_{0}}-\bar{K})^2}{(n-1)s^{2}_{K}}\right]} \quad \quad \text{(4)} \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\bar{K}\)</span> is the mean cumulative catch, <span class="math">\(s^{2}_{K}\)</span> is the variance of the cumulative catch, and <span class="math">\(s_{y|x}\)</span> is the standard deviation about the regression line. Thus, with these standard error formulas, confidence intervals for <span class="math">\(q\)</span> and <span class="math">\(N_{0}\)</span> are computed in the standard way assuming normal distributions.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Ricker (1975)</span> suggested a modification to Equation 3 such that <span class="math">\(K_{t-1}\)</span> is replaced with <span class="math">\(K_{t}\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(K_{t}\)</span> is equal to <span class="math">\(K_{t-1}\)</span> plus half of the current catch, <span class="math">\(C_{t}\)</span>, or</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ K_{t} = K_{t-1} + \frac{C_{t}}{2} \]</span></p>
<p>Thus, Equation 3 becomes</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \frac{C_{t}}{f_{t}} = qN_{0} - qK_{t} \quad \quad \text{(5)} \]</span></p>
<p>and <span class="math">\(q\)</span>, <span class="math">\(qN_{0}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(N_{0}\)</span> are estimated with regression methods as with Equation 3. This modification will typically (but not always) result in slightly higher estimates of <span class="math">\(N_{0}\)</span>.</p>
<div id="assumptions" class="section level3">
<h3>Assumptions</h3>
<p>The Leslie method for estimating the initial population size is built upon six assumptions related to the fish and fishery. These assumptions are</p>
<ul>
<li>the population is closed (i.e., closed to sources of animals such as recruitment and immigration and losses of animals due to natural mortality and emigration),</li>
<li>catchability is constant over the period of removals,</li>
<li>enough fish must be removed to substantially reduce the catch-per-unit-effort,</li>
<li>the catches remove more than 2% of the population,</li>
<li>all fish are equally vulnerable to the method of capture – sources of error may include gear saturation and trap-happy or trap-shy individuals, and</li>
<li>the units of effort are independent - i.e., the individual units of the method of capture (i.e., nets, traps, etc) do not compete with each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the usual assumptions of simple linear regression also apply.</p>
<p>The two most likely assumption violations are that the population is not closed and the catchability is not constant. Any recruitment, natural mortality, immigration, or emigration will likely introduce serious errors to the abundance estimate <span class="citation">(Seber 1982)</span>. Influxes (e.g., recruitment and immigration) tend to dampen the decline of CPE with cumulative catch resulting in an underestimated catchability coefficient and overestimated initial population size. In contrast, natural ``removals’’ (e.g., mortality and emigration) tend to steepen the decline of CPE with cumulative catch, resulting in an overestimated catchability and underestimated initial population size. Errors associated with an open population are typically minimized by concentrating on small, relatively confined areas (e.g., bays, confined stretches of streams) or, more commonly, short periods of time. Unfortunately, violations of the closed population assumption are not readily detectable from catch and effort data.</p>
<p>If the population is thought to be closed, then inconstant catchability is probably the greatest potential source of error in applying the Leslie method <span class="citation">(Ricker 1975)</span>. Catchability may change with time because the individuals that are more readily captured have already been captured and animals with lower individual catchabilities remain in the population <span class="citation">(Hilborn and Walters 2001)</span>, or because of some environmental factor (e.g., increases in movements due to temperature, etc.; <span class="citation">Seber (1982)</span>). <span class="citation">Hilborn and Walters (2001)</span> suggest that lowering catchability with time will result in an overestimate of catchability and an underestimate of the initial population size. The presence of large numbers of animals with low catchability may be indicated by a flattening of the CPE versus cumulative catch plot; i.e., a non-linear relationship between CPE and cumulative catch.</p>
<p>Violations of the other assumptions will result in the Leslie model not fitting or being inappropriate for the collected data. For example, if not all fish are equally vulnerable or the units of effort are dependent, then CPE will not be directly proportional to <span class="math">\(N_{t}\)</span> (i.e., Equation 2 is inappropriate). Alternatively, if too few fish are caught such that the CPE is not substantially reduced, then the relationship between CPE and <span class="math">\(N_{t}\)</span> will likely not exist.</p>
<p>In situations where fewer than 2% of the population will be removed by the catches, then the <a href="#delury-method">DeLury method</a> should be used. In most situations, it is unlikely that it will be known in advance whether 2% of the population will be removed or not. Thus, it is common to fit both the Leslie and DeLury methods to the data. The resultant estimates of <span class="math">\(q\)</span> and <span class="math">\(N_{0}\)</span> should be compared; if the estimates are substantially different then potential reasons for the differences should be explored (including what proportion of the population was removed).</p>

<p>Methods for performing the Leslie method in R are described in Section 10.1 of <span class="citation">Ogle (2016)</span>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<div id="delury-method" class="section level1">
<h1>DeLury Method</h1>
<p>When the fraction of the stock removed by a unit of fishing effort is small (less than 0.02), then <span class="math">\(q\)</span> can be thought of as an instantaneous rate. Furthermore, if the population is closed, such that the only source of change in the population is due to this fishing effort, then the fraction of the population remaining at the time of the <span class="math">\(t\)</span>th removal is</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \frac{N_{t}}{N_{0}} = e^{-qE_{t-1}} \quad \quad \text{(6)} \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(E_{t-1}\)</span> is the cumulative effort prior to time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ E_{t-1} = f_{1} + f_{2} + \ldots + f_{t-1} = \sum_{i=1}^{t-1} f_{i} \]</span></p>
<p>Rearranging Equation 6 expresses <span class="math">\(N_{t}\)</span> as a function of <span class="math">\(N_{0}\)</span>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="math">\[ N_{t} = N_{0}e^{-qE_{t-1}} \quad \quad \text{(7)} \]</span></p>
<p>Substituting Equation 7 into Equation 2 yields,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \frac{C_{t}}{f_{t}} = qN_{0}e^{-qE_{t-1}} \quad \quad \text{(8)} \]</span></p>
<p>Logarithms of both sides of Equation 8 gives,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ log\left(\frac{C_{t}}{f_{t}}\right) = log(qN_{0}) + log\left(e^{-qE_{t-1}}\right)  \quad \quad \text{    } \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \left(\frac{C_{t}}{f_{t}}\right) = log(qN_{0}) - qE_{t-1}  \quad \quad \text{(9)} \]</span></p>
<p>The last expression of Equation 9 is in the form of a linear model  where <span class="math">\(log\left(\frac{C_{t}}{f_{t}}\right)\)</span> is the response variable, <span class="math">\(E_{t-1}\)</span> is the explanatory variable, <span class="math">\(-q\)</span> is a constant (i.e., the slope), and <span class="math">\(log(qN_{0})\)</span> is the log of the product of two constants and, thus, is a constant (i.e., the intercept). Thus, the <em>negative of the slope</em> of this model is an estimate of the catchability coefficient, <span class="math">\(\hat{q}\)</span>. The estimated initial population size, <span class="math">\(\hat{N_{0}}\)</span>, is derived by using the intercept as the power of <span class="math">\(e\)</span> (i.e., <span class="math">\(e^{intercept}\)</span>) and dividing by <span class="math">\(\hat{q}\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="BKG_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" title="" alt="" width="336" /></p>
<p>As with the Leslie method, <span class="citation">Ricker (1975)</span> suggested a modification to Equation 9, namely that <span class="math">\(E_{t-1}\)</span> be replaced with <span class="math">\(E_{t}\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(E_{t}\)</span> is equal to <span class="math">\(E_{t-1}\)</span> plus half of the effort expended at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math">\(f_{t}\)</span>, or</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ E_{t} = E_{t-1} + \frac{f_{t}}{2} \]</span></p>
<p>Thus, Equation 9 is replaced with</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ log\left(\frac{C_{t}}{f_{t}}\right) = log(qN_{0}) - qE_{t}   \quad \quad \text{(10)} \]</span></p>
<p>Ricker’s correction usually results in slightly higher estimates of <span class="math">\(N_{0}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The assumptions of the DeLury method are the same as the assumptions for the Leslie method except that the DeLury method is used when the removals are less than 2% of the population. If the catches remove more that 2% of the population, then it is best to use the Leslie method as it is more flexible (e.g., CPE estimates need not be from the same fishing gear as the cumulative catches).</p>

<div id="k-pass-methods" class="section level1">
<h1>k-Pass Methods</h1>
<p>Another depletion method for estimating population size is the k-Pass removal methods. In this method, a closed population is repeatedly sampled <span class="math">\(k\)</span> times<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> with the same amount of effort. On each sampling “pass,” the number of individuals captured are recorded, and the individuals are physically removed from the population. With certain assumptions, the overall population size can be estimated from the number of animals successively removed.</p>
<p>Under the assumptions that the population is closed (except for the removal of animals at each pass) and that the probability of capture for an animal (defined as <span class="math">\(p\)</span>) is constant for all animals and from sample to sample, then the likelihood function for the vector of successive catches, <span class="math">\(\vec{C}\)</span>, given the population size, <span class="math">\(N_{0}\)</span>, and probability of capture is</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ L(\vec{C}|N_{0},p) = \frac{N_{0}!p^{T}q^{kN_{0}-X-T}}{(N_{0}-T)!\prod_{i=1}^{k}C_{i}!} \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(q=1-p\)</span> is the probability of escape, <span class="math">\(C_{i}\)</span> is the number of animals captured in the <span class="math">\(i\)</span>th removal period, <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is the total number of removal periods, <span class="math">\(T=\sum_{i=1}^{k}C_{i}\)</span> is the total number of individuals captured, and <span class="math">\(X=\sum_{i=1}^{k}(k-i)C_{i}\)</span> . Unfortunately, the maximization of this likelihood function is not ``neat’’ and is beyond the scope of this vignette. Fortunately, <span class="citation">Zippin (1956)</span> and <span class="citation">Zippin (1958)</span> showed a method for iteratively solving for <span class="math">\(q\)</span> and <span class="math">\(N_{0}\)</span>. <span class="citation">Carle and Strub (1978)</span> later showed a slight modification of Zippin’s method where the smallest <span class="math">\(N_{0}\geq T\)</span> that solves</p>
<p>$$ (N_{0}+)(kN_{0}-X-T)^{k} - (N_{0}-T+)(kN_{0}-X)^{k} 0 </p>
<p>is the maximum likelihood estimate.</p>
<p>Once <span class="math">\(N_{0}\)</span> is found by iteratively solving  then,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ SE_{\widehat{N_{0}}} = \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{N_{0}}\left(1-q^{k}\right)q^{k}}{\left(1-q^{k}\right)^{2}-(pk)^{2}q^{k-1}}} \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \hat{p} = \frac{T}{kN_{0}-X} \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[ SE_{\hat{p}} = \frac{(qp)^{2}\left(1-q^{k}\right)}{\widehat{N_{0}}\left[q\left(1-q^{k}\right)^{2}-(pk)^{2}q^{k}\right]} \]</span></p>
<p><span class="citation">Carle and Strub (1978)</span> note that the general k-Pass removal method will fail to provide an appropriate estimate of population size if <span class="math">\(X\leq\frac{T(k-1)}{2}\)</span>. This failure criterion is equal to <span class="math">\(X\leq T\)</span> or, for example, <span class="math">\(C_{1}\leq C_{3}\)</span> when <span class="math">\(k=3\)</span>. Thus, the method outlined above will fail if the number of fish removed on the last pass is greater than or equal to the number of fish removed on the first pass. In other words, similar to the Leslie and DeLury methods, the k-pass removal methods will perform appropriately only if the catches are substantially reduced by prior removals.</p>
<p>An alternative iterative method that will not fail and has lower bias and standard error was proposed by <span class="citation">Carle and Strub (1978)</span>. This method takes a Bayesian approach and ``weights’’ the likelihood function by a prior beta distribution (with parameters <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span>). Their method reduces to finding the smallest <span class="math">\(N_{0}\geq T\)</span> that solves</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \frac{N_{0}+1}{N_{0}-T+1}\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{kN_{0}-X-T+\beta+k-i}{kN_{0}-X+\alpha+\beta+k-i} \leq 1 \quad \quad \text{(12)} \]</span></p>
<p>Once <span class="math">\(N_{0}\)</span> is found by iteratively solving the equation above then,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ SE_{\widehat{N_{0}}} = \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{N_{0}}T(\widehat{N_{0}}-T)}{T^{2}-\widehat{N_{0}}(\widehat{N_{0}}-T)\frac{(kp)^{2}}{q}}} \]</span></p>
<p>and <span class="math">\(\hat{p}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(SE_{\hat{p}}\)</span> as defined above. Typically, if no prior information about <span class="math">\(p\)</span> exists then <span class="math">\(\alpha=\beta=1\)</span> is used.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that all of the k-pass removal methods are highly susceptible to the common violation of the equal catchability assumption. <span class="citation">Seber (1982)</span> notes that ``if there is considerable variability in catchability, the more catchable individuals will be caught first, so that the average probability of capture will decrease from one trapping to the next and [<span class="math">\(\widehat{N_{0}}\)</span>] will underestimate [<span class="math">\(N_{0}\)</span>].’’</p>
