<h2>Lake Ontario Rock Bass A</h2>
<ol>
<li>There are 135 fish that were aged and 1153 fish that were not aged.</li>
<li>xxx
<ol>
<li>There were 10 fish in the 180-mm category in the aged sample.</li>
<li>There were 24 age-7 fish in the aged sample.</li>
<li>The proportion of fish in the 140-mm TL category that were age-4 was 0.9.</li>
<li>The proportion of fish in the 200-mm TL category that were age-8 was 0.1.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>xxx
<ol>
<li>The proportion of fish in the 210-mm TL category that should be assigned age-5 was 0.1.</li>
<li>Of 30 Rock Bass in the 180-mm TL category, 12 should be assigned age-5.</li>
<li>This age-length key is pretty “clean.” There are some anomolies with age-8 and age-9 fish near 200 mm and age-11 fish from 230 to 270 mm, but these proportions are fairly small.</li>

<li>Did not do.</li>

<h2>Lake Ontario Rock Bass B</h2>
<ol>
<li>Completed above.</li>
<li>xxx
<ol>
<li>There were 264 age-5 fish after applying the age-length key.</li>
<li>There were 8 age-11 fish after applying the age-length key.</li>
<li>xxx</li>
<li>There were 43 total fish in the 150-mm TL category.</li>
<li>The mean TL of age-5 fish is 187.4 mm.</li>
<li>xxx</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Should not have gotten the exact same results, but they should be close. They are different because of the randomization, but they are similar because little is randomized.</li>
