## Prepare Software/Apps
The following apps should be initiated before the first day of class.

* [MS Teams Course Site](PREP/MSTeams_Intro){:target="_blank"}
    * Note that there is a short assignment at the end of this description that should  be completed before the first day of class.
* [Gradescope Grading Site](PREP/Gradescope_Intro){:target="_blank"}
    * You should have received an e-mail from me inviting you to activate a GradeScope account and join this class. Make sure to follow the directions in that e-mail. Contact me if you did not get that e-mail.

If you plan to use your own computer to run R/RStudio then you should complete the following items before the first day of class. Note the required version numbers below. If you have previously installed these softwares then you may need to update them. If you plan to use the college computers you do not need to do the next four items.

* Install R (*at least v 4.0.0*) ... [for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.0.3-win.exe) ... [for Macs](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-4.0.3.pkg) ... *just accept defaults*
* Install RStudio (*at least v 1.3.0*) ... [Choose Windows/Mac here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download){:target="_blank"} ... *just accept defaults*
* Install FSA (*at least v 0.9.1*) ... in RStudio, select the "Packages" tab in one of the panes (likely lower right), press the "Install" button, type "FSA" (without the quotes) under "Packages" in the dialog box, press the "Install" button, and be patient as several packages are installed. 
* Install FSASims ... copy-and-paste the following three lines into the "Console" of RStudio (and hit return)

```
if (!require('manipulate')) utils::install.packages('manipulate')
if (!require('remotes')) install.packages('remotes'); require('remotes')
remotes::install_github('droglenc/FSASims',type='binary')
```

* Install Microsoft Word and Excel (from the Office 365 Suite) ... [follow these directions](https://my.northland.edu/campus-life/campus-services/technology/#accessing-installing-office-365){:target="_blank"}
    * The web-based versions of Excel and Word are not adequate for our purposes; you need the "full" versions.
    * This software is free to Northland students as described in the link.

<br>

Regardless if you use your own computer or not, you should do the following before the first day of class.

* Create a folder where you will save all of your work (especially R work) for this course this semester. If you are using the College's computers I suggest creating this folder on the "T:/" drive.

Contact me if you have any issues with any of the above items.
