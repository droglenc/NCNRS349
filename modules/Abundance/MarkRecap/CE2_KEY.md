## Questions 1

1. Over-estimates consistently.
1. Accurately estimates.
1. No, though Chapman is less accurate at very small recapture values.
1. Chapman is unbiased.

----

## Questions 2

1. No trends, Chapman is always unbiased
1. Yes, when M and n were both large.  The rule says that if m>50 then use the normal distribution.  This would correspond (roughly) to M*n>50000 in this simulation because N=1000.  Thus, samples like M=250 and n=200 should produce normal sampling distributions.  This did not always seem to be the case.
1. The CI width became progressively narrower.
1. The CI width became progressively narrower.
1. Generally an equal allocation.  However, slightly more on the second day may be slightly better.  Yes, this generalizes.
1. An even allocation assumes that handling fish on the two days is the same.  This is unlikely to be realistic as it generally takes more time to tag fish then it takes to look for tags.  The analysis could be modified to include a handling time cost.  This would likely result in asking the crew to work harder on the first day to tag as many fish as possible.

## Questions 3

1. Personal expectations.

## Questions 4

1. TAG LOSS - Overestimate initial, Overestimate final
1. MORTALITIY - Accurately estimate initial, Overestimate final
1. TAG MORTALITY - Overestimate initial, Overestimate final
1. UNTAG MORTALITY - Underestimate initial, Accurately estimate final
1. RECRUITMENT - Overestimate initial, Accurately estimate final
1. TRAP HAPPY - Underestimate initial, Underestimate final
1. TRAP SHY -- Overestimate initial, Overestimate final
1. Tag loss or mortality of tagged fish
1. Increased catchability of tagged fish

----

## Questions 5

1. INITIAL -- If there is mortality on both tagged and untagged fish.
1. FINAL -- If there is tag loss, mortality on untagged fish
1. BOTH -- None.
1. All about equal.
