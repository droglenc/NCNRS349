# Weight-Length Relationships

Modeling the relationship between length and weight of a species of fish has been considered a routine analysis for which the results do not warrant publication [@Froese2006] or has been scorned as being of little value [@HilbornWalters2001].  However, the recent review of methods and the meta-analysis of a large number of length-weight relationships by @Froese2006 demonstrated that a synthetic analysis of length-weight relationships for a species can provide important insights into the ecology of that species.

The relationship between the length and weight of a fish is used by fisheries researchers and managers for two main purposes [@LeCren1951].  First, the relationship is used to predict the weight from the length of a fish.  This is particularly useful for computing the biomass of a sample of fish from the length-frequency of that sample.  Second, the parameter estimates of the relationship for a population of fish can be compared to average parameters for the region, parameter estimates from previous years, or parameter estimates among groups of fish to identify the relative condition or robustness of the population.  By convention, this second purpose is usually generically referred to as describing the *condition* of the species.


### Weight-Length Data

The required data for examining the length-weight relationship for a sample of fish is measurements of the length ($L$) and weight ($W$) of individual fish at the time of capture (e.g., `r tblcaps("LWDataEx",display="cite")`).  Any other data about individual fish, such as month or year of capture, are of capture, etc. can also be recorded.

\ 

`r tblcaps("LWDataEx")`
 
<table style="width:80%">
<tr><td><b>month</b></td><td><b>day</b></td><td><b>year</b></td><td><b>individual</b></td><td><b>length</b></td><td><b>weight</b></td></tr>

Three types of length measurements are common in the fisheries literature `r figcaps("LengthMeasures",display="cite")`.  *Total length* (TL) is the length from the most anterior to the most posterior point with the tail of the fish compressed to exhibit the longest possible length.  *Fork length* (FL) is the length from the most anterior point to the anterior notch in the fork of the tail.  For fish without a forked tail, the fork and total lengths are the same.  The *standard length* (SL) is the length from the most anterior point to the posterior end of the caudal peduncle.  Total length is the most common measurement in fisheries studies, as this is the measurement used in management decisions such as setting minimum lengths.

`r figcaps("LengthMeasures")`

\ 

Length measurements are often taken with the aid of a measuring board where the measuring "stick" is embedded into the bottom board and one end of this board is fit with a vertical end piece.  The fish to be measured is placed on the bottom board such that the anterior point of the fish is against the vertical end piece and the measurement can be read directly from the embedded measuring stick (`r figcaps("LengthWeightMeasure",display="cite")`).  Length measurements are subject to very little measurement error [@GutreuterKrzoska1994].

![Length Measurements](LengthWeightMeasure.png)

`r figcaps("LengthWeightMeasure")`

\ 

Two common weight measurements are used.  The usual body weight is the weight of the fish as it was captured, whereas the dressed weight is the weight of the fish with the gills and entrails removed.  Dressed weight is usually only used when measurements are reported from a commercial fishery.

Weight measurements can be made in the field on fresh specimens or in the lab on fresh-frozen specimens.  Weight measurements in the field can be taken with tared spring or electronic balances (`r figcaps("LengthWeightMeasure",display="cite")`).  However, field measurements can be extremely variable due to differences in fish surface wetness, boat movements, wind, and other adverse environmental conditions [@GutreuterKrzoska1994].  Substantial variability in weight measurements can occur when fish weigh less than 10% of a scale's capacity [@GutreuterKrzoska1994].  Thus, multiple sizes of scales should be taken into the field [@Blackwelletal2000].  @WegeAnderson1978} suggest that the accuracy of the scale should be $\pm$1% of a fish's body weight for use in relative weight calculations.  Weight measurements on frozen fish were roughly 1-9% lighter than the measurements on the same fish when fresh, whereas length measurements were roughly 1-4% shorter on frozen then fresh fish for a variety of species (reviewed in @Ogle2009).

### Weight-Length Model

The relationship between the length and weight of a sample of fish tends to have two important characteristics.  First, the relationship is not linear \figrefp{fig:RuffeRawLW}.  This can be explained intuitively by  thinking of length as a linear measure and weight as being related to volume.  Thus, as the organism adds a linear amount of length, it is adding a disk of volume with a commensurate weight.  Second, the variability in weight increases as the length of the fish increases (i.e., the scatter of the points increases from left-to-right in `r figcaps("RuffeRawLW",display="cite")`.  Thus, variability in weight among shorter fish is less then variability in weight among longer fish.  Unfortunately, because of these two characteristics, length-weight data tends to violate the linearity and homoscedasticity (i.e., "constant variance") assumptions of simple linear regression.

```{r echo=FALSE, par1=TRUE}
plot(weight~length,data=ruffe2,pch=19,
     xlab="Total Length (mm)",ylab="Weight (g)",xlim=c(0,200),cex=0.5)
```

`r figcaps("RuffeRawLW")`

\ 

These characteristics of length-weight data suggest that a two-parameter power function with a multiplicative error term should be used to model the length-weight relationship.  Specifically, the model typically used is

$$ W_{i} = aL_{i}^{b}e^{\epsilon_{i}} \quad \quad \text{`r paste0("(",eqncaps("LWModel",display="num"),")")`} $$

where $a$ and $b$ are constants and $\epsilon_{i}$ is the multiplicative error term for the $i$th fish.  The length-weight model `r eqncaps("LWModel",display="cite")` can be *transformed* to a linear model by taking the natural logarithms[^1] of both sides and simplifying,

$$ log(W_{i}) = log(a) + blog(L_{i}) + \epsilon_{i} \quad \quad \text{`r paste0("(",eqncaps("LWModel",display="num"),")")`} $$

Thus, with $y=log(W)$, $x=log(L)$, slope=$b$, and intercept=$log(a)$, `r eqncaps("LWTransformModel",display="cite")` is in the form of a linear model.  In addition to linearizing the model, this transformation has the added benefit of making the errors additive and stabilizing the variances about the model (i.e., making the scatter around the line nearly constant for all length measurements;  `r figcaps("RuffeTransLW",display="cite")`).  With this linearization and stabilization, the usual linear regression methods can be used to fit the relationship between $log(W)$ and $log(L)$.

```{r echo=FALSE, par1=TRUE}
plot(logW~logL,data=ruffe2,pch=19,
     xlab="log Total Length (mm)",ylab="log Weight (g)",cex=0.5)
```

`r figcaps("RuffeTransLW")`

\ 

It should be noted that, with the example in `r figcaps("RuffeTransLW",display="cite")`, the variability on the log scale appears greater for ``small'' fish.  This is because the scale used to measure these fish lacked the required precision to distinguish weights of small fish over a wide length range.  It is apparent that fish with a log weight of less than -0.5 should be eliminated from this analysis because of scale imprecision for these fish.

### Special Inferences about Slope

If a fish grows without changing its shape or its density then the fish is said to  exhibit *isometric* growth.  In this case, the volume of the fish is proportional to any linear measure of its size.  If weight is taken as a surrogate of volume (which requires assuming a constant density) and length as the linear measure, then the modeled relationship between length and weight, `r eqncaps("LWModel",display="cite")`, will have $b=3$ under isometric growth.  Isometric growth in fish is rare [@BolgerConnolly1989, @McGurk1985].  If a fish changes shape or density as it grows, then $b\neq3$ in `r eqncaps("LWModel",display="cite")`, and the fish is said to exhibit *allometric* growth.  If $b>3$ then the fish tends to become more "plumper" as the fish increases in length [@Blackwelletal2000].

A test of whether the fish in a population exhibit isometric growth or not can be obtained by noting that $b$ is the estimated slope from fitting the transformed length-weight model.  The slope is generically labeled with $\beta$ such that the test for allometry can be translated into the following statistical hypotheses:

* $H_{0}:\beta=3 \quad \Rightarrow H_{0}:$ "Isometric growth"
* $H_{A}:\beta\neq3 \quad \Rightarrow H_{A}:$ "Allometric growth"'
\end{Itemize}

Hypothesis tests regarding model parameters can be obtained with a t-test using

$$ t = \frac{\hat{\beta}-\beta_{0}}{SE_{\hat{\beta}}} $$

where $\hat{\beta}$, $SE_{\hat{\beta}}$ and the df are from the linear regression results and $\beta_{0}$ is the specified value in the $H_{0}$.  Nearly all statistical packages, R included, print the $t$ and corresponding $p-value$ for $H_{0}:\beta=0$ by default, but not for any hypothesized value other than zero.  Thus, the test statistic and p-value for the test of isometry must often be calculated "by hand."
