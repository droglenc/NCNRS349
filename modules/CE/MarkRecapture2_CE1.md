## Summarizing Assumption Violations
Use your results from [the class exercise](../CEX/MarkRecapture2_CEX1){:target="_blank"} to provide answers to the following questions.

1. Which assumption violations allow the biologist to still reliably estimate the *initial* population abundance?
1. Which assumption violations allow the biologist to still reliably estimate the *final* population abundance?
1. Which assumption violations allow the biologist to still reliably estimate *both* the initial and final population abundances?
1. What are three things you can do when performing a mark-recapture study that will minimize violating these assumptions?

## Lake Huron Sea Lamprey

Use their results from "**Pre**" period and the **1991** parasitic feeding year in **Table 3** (use the M, C, and R rows) to confirm the population estimate (in the first row of the table) and, hopefully, the confidence interval (in the second and third rows of the table). Show your work and write a formal statement about how your results compare to those in the paper.
