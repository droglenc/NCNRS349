1. Read Sections 7.1-7.4 in *Introductory Fisheries Analyses with R* and [these notes](BKG.html) and consider the items below.
    * What are five things that weight-length relationships are used for?
    * Which are more precise -- length or weight measurements? Explain.
    * What is the difference between a common and natural logarithm?
    * Why is linear regression inappropriate to model weight-length data?
    * Weight-length data follows what kind of function for most fish species?
    * Demonstrate how this function is transformed to a linear function?
    * What parameter does the slope of the transformed model represent?
    * What R function is used to fit a linear regression?
    * What R function is used to extract the regression parameter estimates?
    * What R function is used to extract the regression parameter confidence intervals?
    * What R function is used to determine if there is a significant relationship between weight and length (or their transformed values)?
    * How does one check whether the assumptions of a linear regression have been met or not?
    * What does it mean about fish shape over time if the slope parameter is equal to 3? If it is not equal to 3?
1. Read [Pope and Kruse (2007) Sections 10.1](Pope-Kruse-2007_10_1.pdf) (*the complete chapter [is here](Pope-Kruse-2007.pdf)*) and consider the items below.
    * What are the two things the weight-length relationships have historically been used for?
    * Weight-length data follows what kind of function for most fish species?
    * Demonstrate how this function is transformed to a linear function?
    * What type of values does the b parameter usually take?
    * What value of b is indicative of allometric growth?
    * Define allometric growth?
    * What kinds of "things" can impart a bias in the weight-length relationship?
    * How does one check whether the assumptions of a linear regression have been met or not?
